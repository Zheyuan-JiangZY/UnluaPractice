---Convenience task for spawning actors (optionally limiting the spawning to the network authority). If not the net authority, we will not spawn
---and Success will not be called. The nice thing this adds is the ability to modify expose on spawn properties while also implicitly checking
---network role before spawning.
---Though this task doesn't do much - games can implement similar tasks that carry out game specific rules. For example a 'SpawnProjectile'
---task that limits the available classes to the games projectile class, and that does game specific stuff on spawn (for example, determining
---firing position from a weapon attachment).
---Long term we can also use this task as a sync point. If the executing client could wait execution until the server creates and replicates the
---actor down to him. We could potentially also use this to do predictive actor spawning / reconciliation.
