---@field public SplashDescs TArray<FOculusSplashDesc> @An array of splash screen descriptors listing textures to show and their positions.
---@field public bEnableSpecificColorGamut boolean @If enabled, the target HMD will perform a color space transformation
---@field public ColorSpace EColorSpace @The target color space
---@field public bSupportsDash boolean @Whether Dash is supported by the app, which will keep the app in foreground when the User presses the oculus button (needs the app to handle input focus loss!)
---@field public bCompositesDepth boolean @Whether the app's depth buffer is shared with the Rift Compositor, for layer (including Dash) compositing, PTW, and potentially more.
---@field public bHQDistortion boolean @Computes mipmaps for the eye buffers every frame, for a higher quality distortion
---@field public PixelDensityMin number @Minimum allowed pixel density.
---@field public PixelDensityMax number @Maximum allowed pixel density.
---@field public CPULevel integer @Default CPU level controlling CPU frequency on the mobile device
---@field public GPULevel integer @Default GPU level controlling GPU frequency on the mobile device
---@field public FFRLevel EFixedFoveatedRenderingLevel @Default Fixed Foveated Rendering level for Oculus Quest
---@field public FFRDynamic boolean @Whether FFR adjusts its level dynamically or not
