---At certain times we want a single menu entry that represents a set of
---UBlueprintNodeSpawners (generally when all those UBlueprintNodeSpawners wrap
---the same UField). We do this to keep the menu less jumbled, and instead
---use the drag/drop action to present a sub-menu to the user (so they can pick
---the the node type that they want). We do this with both delegates and
---variable nodes (where the user can pick a getter vs. a setter, etc.).
---This class represents those "consolidated" actions, and essentially serves
---as a FDragDropOperation spawner. It wraps a single UBlueprintNodeSpawner (any
---one of the set that it is supposed to represent), that it uses to determine
---the proper FDragDropOperation.
---@class FBlueprintDragDropMenuItem : FEdGraphSchemaAction
local FBlueprintDragDropMenuItem = {}
