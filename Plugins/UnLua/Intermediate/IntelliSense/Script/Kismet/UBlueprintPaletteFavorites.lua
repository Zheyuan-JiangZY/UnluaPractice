---@field public CurrentFavorites TArray<FFavoritedBlueprintPaletteItem> @A list of favorites that is constructed in PostLoad() (either from a profile or the user's set of CustomFavorites). This list is up to date and maintained at runtime.
---@field public CurrentProfile string @Users could load pre-existing profiles (intended to share favorites, and hook into tutorials). If empty, the default profile will be loaded; if the user has customized a pre-existing profile, then this will be "CustomProfile".
