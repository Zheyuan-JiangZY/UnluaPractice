---Default physics settings.
---@class UPhysicsSettingsCore : UDeveloperSettings
---@field public DefaultGravityZ number @Default gravity.
---@field public DefaultTerminalVelocity number @Default terminal velocity for Physics Volumes.
---@field public DefaultFluidFriction number @Default fluid friction for Physics Volumes.
---@field public SimulateScratchMemorySize integer @Amount of memory to reserve for PhysX simulate(), this is per pxscene and will be rounded up to the next 16K boundary
---@field public RagdollAggregateThreshold integer @Threshold for ragdoll bodies above which they will be added to an aggregate before being added to the scene
---@field public TriangleMeshTriangleMinAreaThreshold number @Triangles from triangle meshes (BSP) with an area less than or equal to this value will be removed from physics collision data. Set to less than 0 to disable.
---@field public bEnableShapeSharing boolean @Enables shape sharing between sync and async scene for static rigid actors
---@field public bEnablePCM boolean @Enables persistent contact manifolds. This will generate fewer contact points, but with more accuracy. Reduces stability of stacking, but can help energy conservation.
---@field public bEnableStabilization boolean @Enables stabilization of contacts for slow moving bodies. This will help improve the stability of stacking.
---@field public bWarnMissingLocks boolean @Whether to warn when physics locks are used incorrectly. Turning this off is not recommended and should only be used by very advanced users.
---@field public bEnable2DPhysics boolean @Can 2D physics be used (Box2D)?
---@field public BounceThresholdVelocity number @Minimum relative velocity required for an object to bounce. A typical value for simulation stability is about 0.2 * gravity
---@field public FrictionCombineMode integer @Friction combine mode, controls how friction is computed for multiple materials.
---@field public RestitutionCombineMode integer @Restitution combine mode, controls how restitution is computed for multiple materials.
---@field public MaxAngularVelocity number @Max angular velocity that a simulated object can achieve.
---@field public MaxDepenetrationVelocity number @Max velocity which may be used to depenetrate simulated physics objects. 0 means no maximum.
---@field public ContactOffsetMultiplier number @Contact offset multiplier. When creating a physics shape we look at its bounding volume and multiply its minimum value by this multiplier. A bigger number will generate contact points earlier which results in higher stability at the cost of performance.
---@field public MinContactOffset number @Min Contact offset.
---@field public MaxContactOffset number @Max Contact offset.
---@field public bSimulateSkeletalMeshOnDedicatedServer boolean @If true, simulate physics for this component on a dedicated server. This should be set if simulating physics and replicating with a dedicated server.
---@field public DefaultShapeComplexity integer @Determines the default physics shape complexity.
---@field public SolverOptions FChaosSolverConfiguration @Options to apply to Chaos solvers on creation
