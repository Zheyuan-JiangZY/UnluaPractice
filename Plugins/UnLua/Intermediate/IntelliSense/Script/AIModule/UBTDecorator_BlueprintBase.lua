---Base class for blueprint based decorator nodes. Do NOT use it for creating native c++ classes!
---Unlike task and services, decorator have two execution chains:
--- ExecutionStart-ExecutionFinish and ObserverActivated-ObserverDeactivated
---which makes automatic latent action cleanup impossible. Keep in mind, that
---you HAVE TO verify is given chain is still active after resuming from any
---latent action (like Delay, Timelines, etc).
---Helper functions:
---- IsDecoratorExecutionActive (true after ExecutionStart, until ExecutionFinish)
---- IsDecoratorObserverActive (true after ObserverActivated, until ObserverDeactivated)
