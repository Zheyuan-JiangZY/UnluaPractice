---Implements the settings for the Windows target platform. The first instance of this class is initialized in
---WindowsTargetPlatform, really early during the startup sequence before the CDO has been constructed, so its config
---settings are read manually from there.
---@class UWindowsTargetSettings : UObject
---@field public Compiler ECompilerVersion @The compiler version to use for this project. May be different to the chosen IDE.
---@field public TargetedRHIs TArray<string> @The collection of RHI's we want to support on this platform. This is not always the full list of RHI we can support.
---@field public DefaultGraphicsRHI EDefaultGraphicsRHI @Default Graphics RHI. Select which RHIto use. Make sure its also selected as a Targeted RHI Requires Editor restart
---@field public MinimumOSVersion EMinimumSupportedOS @Determine the minimum supported
---@field public AudioSampleRate integer @Sample rate to run the audio mixer with.
---@field public AudioCallbackBufferFrameSize integer @The amount of audio to compute each callback block. Lower values decrease latency but may increase CPU cost.
---@field public AudioNumBuffersToEnqueue integer @The number of buffers to keep enqueued. More buffers increases latency, but can compensate for variable compute availability in audio callbacks on some platforms.
---@field public AudioMaxChannels integer @The max number of channels (voices) to limit for this platform. The max channels used will be the minimum of this value and the global audio quality settings. A value of 0 will not apply a platform channel count max.
---@field public AudioNumSourceWorkers integer @The number of workers to use to compute source audio. Will only use up to the max number of sources. Will evenly divide sources to each source worker.
---@field public SpatializationPlugin string @Which of the currently enabled spatialization plugins to use on Windows.
---@field public ReverbPlugin string @Which of the currently enabled reverb plugins to use on Windows.
---@field public OcclusionPlugin string @Which of the currently enabled occlusion plugins to use on Windows.
---@field public CompressionOverrides FPlatformRuntimeAudioCompressionOverrides @Various overrides for how this platform should handle compression and decompression
---@field public bUseAudioStreamCaching boolean @When this is enabled, Actual compressed data will be separated from the USoundWave, and loaded into a cache.
---@field public CacheSizeKB integer @This determines the max amount of memory that should be used for the cache at any given time. If set low (<= 8 MB), it lowers the size of individual chunks of audio during cook.
---@field public MaxChunkSizeOverrideKB integer @This overrides the default max chunk size used when chunking audio for stream caching (ignored if < 0)
---@field public bResampleForDevice boolean
---@field public MaxSampleRate number @Mapping of which sample rates are used for each sample rate quality for a specific platform.
---@field public HighSampleRate number
---@field public MedSampleRate number
---@field public LowSampleRate number
---@field public MinSampleRate number
---@field public CompressionQualityModifier number @Scales all compression qualities when cooking to this platform. For example, 0.5 will halve all compression qualities, and 1.0 will leave them unchanged.
---@field public AutoStreamingThreshold number @When set to anything beyond 0, this will ensure any SoundWaves longer than this value, in seconds, to stream directly off of the disk.
---@field public SoundCueCookQualityIndex integer @Quality Level to COOK SoundCues at (if set, all other levels will be stripped by the cooker).
