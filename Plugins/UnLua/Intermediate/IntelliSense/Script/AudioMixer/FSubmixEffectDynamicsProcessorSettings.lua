---Submix dynamics processor settings
---@class FSubmixEffectDynamicsProcessorSettings
---@field public DynamicsProcessorType ESubmixEffectDynamicsProcessorType @Type of processor to apply
---@field public PeakMode ESubmixEffectDynamicsPeakMode @Mode of peak detection used on input key signal
---@field public LinkMode ESubmixEffectDynamicsChannelLinkMode @Mode of peak detection if key signal is multi-channel
---@field public InputGainDb number @The input gain of the dynamics processor
---@field public ThresholdDb number @The threshold at which to perform a dynamics processing operation
---@field public Ratio number @The dynamics processor ratio used for compression/expansion
---@field public KneeBandwidthDb number @The knee bandwidth of the processor to use
---@field public LookAheadMsec number @The amount of time to look ahead of the current audio (Allows for transients to be included in dynamics processing)
---@field public AttackTimeMsec number @The amount of time to ramp into any dynamics processing effect
---@field public ReleaseTimeMsec number @The amount of time to release the dynamics processing effect
---@field public KeySource ESubmixEffectDynamicsKeySource
---@field public ExternalAudioBus UAudioBus @If set, uses output of provided audio bus as modulator of input signal for dynamics processor (Uses input signal as default modulator)
---@field public ExternalSubmix USoundSubmix @If set, uses output of provided submix as modulator of input signal for dynamics processor (Uses input signal as default modulator)
---@field public bAnalogMode boolean @Toggles treating the attack and release envelopes as analog-style vs digital-style (Analog will respond a bit more naturally/slower)
---@field public bBypass boolean @Whether or not to bypass effect
---@field public bKeyAudition boolean @Audition the key modulation signal, bypassing enveloping and processing the input signal.
---@field public KeyGainDb number @Gain to apply to key signal if key source not set to default (input).
---@field public OutputGainDb number @The output gain of the dynamics processor
---@field public KeyHighshelf FSubmixEffectDynamicProcessorFilterSettings @High Shelf filter settings for key signal (external signal if supplied or input signal if not)
---@field public KeyLowshelf FSubmixEffectDynamicProcessorFilterSettings @Low Shelf filter settings for key signal (external signal if supplied or input signal if not)
