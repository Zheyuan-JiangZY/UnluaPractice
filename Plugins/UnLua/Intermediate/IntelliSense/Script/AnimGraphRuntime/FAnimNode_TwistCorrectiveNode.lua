---This is the node that apply corrective morphtarget for twist
---Good example is that if you twist your neck too far right or left, you're going to see odd stretch shape of neck,
---This node can detect the angle and apply morphtarget curve
---This isn't the twist control node for bone twist
---@class FAnimNode_TwistCorrectiveNode : FAnimNode_SkeletalControlBase
---@field public BaseFrame FReferenceBoneFrame @Base Frame of the reference for the twist node
---@field public TwistFrame FReferenceBoneFrame @Transform component to use as input
---@field public TwistPlaneNormalAxis FAxis @Normal of the Plane that we'd like to calculate angle calculation from in BaseFrame. Please note we're looking for Normal Axis
---@field public RangeMax number @Maximum limit of the input value (mapped to RemappedMax, only used when limiting the source range) We can't go more than 180 right now because this is dot product driver
---@field public RemappedMin number @Minimum value to apply to the destination (remapped from the input range)
---@field public RemappedMax number @Maximum value to apply to the destination (remapped from the input range)
