---This node uses a source transform of a socket on the skeletal mesh to automatically calculate
---Yaw and Pitch directions for a referenced aim offset given a point in the world to look at.
---@class FAnimNode_AimOffsetLookAt : FAnimNode_BlendSpacePlayer
---@field public BasePose FPoseLink
---@field public LODThreshold integer @* Max LOD that this node is allowed to run * For example if you have LODThreadhold to be 2, it will run until LOD 2 (based on 0 index) * when the component LOD becomes 3, it will stop update/evaluate * currently transition would be issue and that has to be re-visited
---@field public SourceSocketName string @Socket to treat as the look at source
---@field public PivotSocketName string @Socket to treat as the look at pivot (optional). This will overwrite the translation of the source socket transform to better match the lookat direction
---@field public LookAtLocation FVector @Location, in world space to look at
---@field public SocketAxis FVector @Axis in the socket transform to consider the 'forward' or look at axis
---@field public Alpha number @Amount of this node to blend into the output pose
