---The FRotationRetargetingInfo is used to provide all of the
---settings required to perform rotational retargeting on a single
---transform.
---@class FRotationRetargetingInfo
---@field public bEnabled boolean @Set to true this enables retargeting
---@field public Source FTransform @The source transform of the frame of reference. The rotation is made relative to this space
---@field public Target FTransform @The target transform to project the rotation. In most cases this is the same as Source
---@field public RotationComponent ERotationComponent @The rotation component to perform retargeting with
---@field public TwistAxis FVector @In case the rotation component is SwingAngle or TwistAngle this vector is used as the twist axis
---@field public bUseAbsoluteAngle boolean @If set to true the angle will be always positive, thus resulting in mirrored rotation both ways
---@field public SourceMinimum number @The minimum value of the source angle in degrees
---@field public SourceMaximum number @The maximum value of the source angle in degrees
---@field public TargetMinimum number @The minimum value of the target angle in degrees (can be the same as SourceMinimum)
---@field public TargetMaximum number @The target value of the target angle in degrees (can be the same as SourceMaximum)
---@field public EasingType EEasingFuncType @The easing to use - pick linear if you don't want to apply any easing
---@field public CustomCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @Custom curve mapping to apply if bApplyCustomCurve is true
---@field public bFlipEasing boolean @If set to true the interpolation value for the easing will be flipped (1.0 - Value)
---@field public EasingWeight number @The amount of easing to apply (value should be 0.0 to 1.0)
---@field public bClamp boolean @If set to true the value for the easing will be clamped between 0.0 and 1.0
