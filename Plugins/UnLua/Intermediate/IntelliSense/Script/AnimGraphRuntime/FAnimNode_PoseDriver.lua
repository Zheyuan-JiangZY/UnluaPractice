---RBF based orientation driver
---@class FAnimNode_PoseDriver : FAnimNode_PoseHandler
---@field public SourcePose FPoseLink @Bones to use for driving parameters based on their transform
---@field public SourceBones TArray<FBoneReference> @Bone to use for driving parameters based on its orientation
---@field public OnlyDriveBones TArray<FBoneReference> @If bFilterDrivenBones is specified, only these bones will be modified by this node
---@field public PoseTargets TArray<FPoseDriverTarget> @Targets used to compare with current pose and drive morphs/poses
---@field public EvalSpaceBone FBoneReference @Optional other bone space to use when reading SourceBone transform. If not specified, we just use local space of SourceBone (ie relative to parent bone)
---@field public RBFParams FRBFParams @Parameters used by RBF solver
---@field public DriveSource EPoseDriverSource @Which part of the transform is read
---@field public DriveOutput EPoseDriverOutput @Whether we should drive poses or curves
---@field public bOnlyDriveSelectedBones boolean @If we should filter bones to be driven using the DrivenBonesFilter array
---@field public bSoloDrivenOnly boolean @Only solo the driven poses, and don't move the source joint(s) to match
---@field public LODThreshold integer @* Max LOD that this node is allowed to run * For example if you have LODThreadhold to be 2, it will run until LOD 2 (based on 0 index) * when the component LOD becomes 3, it will stop update/evaluate * currently transition would be issue and that has to be re-visited
