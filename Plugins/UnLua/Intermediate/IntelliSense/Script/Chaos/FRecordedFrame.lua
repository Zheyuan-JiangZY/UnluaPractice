---Structure describing necessary data to record the results of a physics simulation for rigids.
---Primarily for recording the results of a geometry collection simulation for later playback
---@class FRecordedFrame
---@field public Transforms TArray<FTransform> @List of transforms recorded for this frame. During execution maps one-to-one with the number of particles. This is handed off for processing when written back to the collection. This processing will remove redundant transforms and populate the indices in FRecordedFrame to handle the remapping
---@field public TransformIndices TArray<integer> @After processing, this will map a transform index within this frame out to a body/particle index for the component. This will map back to where the transform was before processing.
---@field public PreviousTransformIndices TArray<integer> @Maps to the position in the Transforms array of the *previous* frame that this entry existed. They can move around as particles either become disabled/enabled or if a particle didn't move since the last frame. This allows us to pick up previous positions for velocities etc.
---@field public DisabledFlags TArray<boolean> @Per-particle list of whether or not they were disabled on this frame. #BGallagher change this to be event based - expensive on memory and beginframe iterations
---@field public Collisions TArray<FSolverCollisionData>
---@field public Breakings TArray<FSolverBreakingData>
---@field public Trailings TSet<FSolverTrailingData>
---@field public Timestamp number
