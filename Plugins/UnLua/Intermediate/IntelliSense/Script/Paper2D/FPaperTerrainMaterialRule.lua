---Rule for a single section of a terrain material
---@class FPaperTerrainMaterialRule
---@field public StartCap UPaperSprite @The sprite to use at the 'left' (closest to spline start) edge of the terrain segment
---@field public Body TArray<UPaperSprite> @A set of sprites to randomly choose to fill up the interior space between the caps in a terrain segment
---@field public EndCap UPaperSprite @The sprite to use at the 'right' (closest to spline end) edge of the terrain segment
---@field public MinimumAngle number @Minimum slope angle (in degrees) to apply this rule
---@field public MaximumAngle number @Maximum slope angle (in degrees) to apply this rule
---@field public bEnableCollision boolean @If true, collision is enabled for sections matching this rule
---@field public CollisionOffset number @How much should the collision be lofted from the spline (positive values go out from the spline, negative values go in to the spline)
---@field public DrawOrder integer @Specify a draw order for different materials in a spline. Smaller draw orders are drawn first, negative values are allowed.
---@field public Description string @Readable description for the rule (unused anywhere, just for clarity when editing the material)
