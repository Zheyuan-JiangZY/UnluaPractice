---Parameters for PhysicsAsset creation
---@class FPhysAssetCreateParams
---@field public MinBoneSize number @Bones that are shorter than this value will be ignored for body creation
---@field public MinWeldSize number @Bones that are smaller than this value will be merged together for body creation
---@field public GeomType integer @The geometry type that should be used when creating bodies
---@field public VertWeight integer @How vertices are mapped to bones when approximating them with bodies
---@field public bAutoOrientToBone boolean @Whether to automatically orient the created bodies to their corresponding bones
---@field public bCreateConstraints boolean @Whether to create constraints between adjacent created bodies
---@field public bWalkPastSmall boolean @Whether to skip small bones entirely (rather than merge them with adjacent bones)
---@field public bBodyForAll boolean @Forces creation of a body for each bone
---@field public bDisableCollisionsByDefault boolean @Whether to disable collision of body with other bodies on creation
---@field public AngularConstraintMode integer @The type of angular constraint to create between bodies
---@field public HullCount integer @When creating multiple convex hulls, the maximum number that will be created.
---@field public MaxHullVerts integer @When creating convex hulls, the maximum verts that should be created
