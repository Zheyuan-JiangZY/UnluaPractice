---@class UTextureFactory : UFactory
---@field public NoCompression boolean
---@field public NoAlpha boolean @If enabled, the texture's alpha channel will be discarded during compression
---@field public bDeferCompression boolean @If enabled, compression is deferred until the texture is saved
---@field public CompressionSettings integer @Compression settings for the texture
---@field public bCreateMaterial boolean @If enabled, a material will automatically be created for the texture
---@field public bRGBToBaseColor boolean @If enabled, link the texture to the created material's base color
---@field public bRGBToEmissive boolean @If enabled, link the texture to the created material's emissive color
---@field public bAlphaToRoughness boolean @If enabled, link the texture's alpha to the created material's roughness
---@field public bAlphaToEmissive boolean @If enabled, link the texture's alpha to the created material's emissive color
---@field public bAlphaToOpacity boolean @If enabled, link the texture's alpha to the created material's opacity
---@field public bAlphaToOpacityMask boolean @If enabled, link the texture's alpha to the created material's opacity mask
---@field public bTwoSided boolean @If enabled, the created material will be two-sided
---@field public Blending integer @The blend mode of the created material
---@field public ShadingModel integer @The shading model of the created material
---@field public MipGenSettings integer @The mip-map generation settings for the texture; Allows customization of the content of the mip-map chain
---@field public LODGroup integer @The group the texture belongs to
---@field public bDitherMipMapAlpha boolean @If enabled, mip-map alpha values will be dithered for smooth transitions
---@field public AlphaCoverageThresholds FVector4 @Channel values to compare to when preserving alpha coverage from a mask for mips
---@field public bPreserveBorder boolean @If enabled, preserve the value of border pixels when creating mip-maps
---@field public bFlipNormalMapGreenChannel boolean @If enabled, the texture's green channel will be inverted. This is useful for some normal maps
---@field public bUsingExistingSettings boolean @If enabled, we are using the existing settings for a texture that already existed.
---@field public bUseHashAsGuid boolean @If enabled, we are using the texture content hash as the guid.
---@field public UdimRegexPattern string @The pattern to use to match UDIM files to indices. Defaults to match a filename that ends with either .1001 or _1001 This 1st and 3rd (optional) capture groups are used as the texture name. The 2nd capture group is considered to be the UDIM index. ie: (Capture Group 1)(\d{4})( Capture Group 3)
---@field public ColorSpaceMode ETextureSourceColorSpace @Mode for how to determine the color space of the source image. Auto will let the factory decide based on header metadata or bit depth. Linear or SRGB will force the color space on the resulting texture.
