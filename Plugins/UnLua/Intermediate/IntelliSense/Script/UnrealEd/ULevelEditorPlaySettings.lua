---@field public bOnlyLoadVisibleLevelsInPIE boolean @True if Play In Editor should only load currently-visible levels in PIE.
---@field public bPreferToStreamLevelsInPIE boolean @Prefer to stream sub-levels from the disk instead of duplicating editor sub-levels
---@field public NewWindowWidth integer @The width of the new view port window in pixels (0 = use the desktop's screen resolution).
---@field public NewWindowHeight integer @The height of the new view port window in pixels (0 = use the desktop's screen resolution).
---@field public NewWindowPosition FIntPoint @The position of the new view port window on the screen in pixels.
---@field public CenterNewWindow boolean @Whether the new window should be centered on the screen.
---@field public PIEAlwaysOnTop boolean @Always have the PIE window on top of the parent windows.
---@field public DisableStandaloneSound boolean @Whether sound should be disabled when playing standalone games.
---@field public AdditionalLaunchParameters string @Extra parameters to be include as part of the command line for the standalone game.
---@field public AdditionalLaunchParametersForMobile string @Extra parameters to be included as part of the command line for a mobile-on-PC standalone game.
---@field public BuildGameBeforeLaunch integer @Whether to build the game before launching on device.
---@field public LaunchConfiguration integer @Which build configuration to use when launching on device.
---@field public PackFilesForLaunch EPlayOnPakFileMode @Whether to content should be stored in pak files when launching on device. */
---@field public bAutoCompileBlueprintsOnLaunch boolean @Whether to automatically recompile dirty Blueprints before launching
---@field public bLaunchSeparateServer boolean @This is a rarely used option that will launch a separate server (possibly hidden in-process depending on RunUnderOneProcess) even if the net mode does not require a server (such as Standalone). If the net mode requires a server (such as Client) a server will be launched for you (regardless of this setting). This allows you to test offline -> server workflows by connecting ("open 127.0.0.1:<ServerPort>") from the offline game.
---@field private PlayNetMode integer @NetMode to use for Play In Editor.
---@field private RunUnderOneProcess boolean @Spawn multiple player windows in a single instance of UE4. This will load much faster, but has potential to have more issues.
---@field private PlayNetDedicated boolean
---@field private PlayNumberOfClients integer @The number of client windows to open. The first one to open will respect the Play In Editor "Modes" option (PIE, PINW), additional clients respect the RunUnderOneProcess setting.
---@field private ServerPort integer @What port used by the server for simple networking
---@field private ClientWindowWidth integer @Width to use when spawning additional windows.
---@field private AutoConnectToServer boolean
---@field private RouteGamepadToSecondWindow boolean @When running multiple player windows in a single process, this option determines how the game pad input gets routed. If unchecked (default) then the 1st game pad is attached to the 1st window, 2nd to the 2nd window, and so on. If it is checked, the 1st game pad goes the 2nd window. The 1st window can then be controlled by keyboard/mouse, which is convenient if two people are testing on the same computer.
---@field private CreateAudioDeviceForEveryPlayer boolean @If checked, a separate audio device is created for every player. If unchecked, a separate audio device is created for only the first two players and uses the main audio device for more than 2 players. Enabling this will allow rendering accurate audio from every player's perspective but will use more CPU. Keep this disabled on lower-perf machines.
---@field private ClientWindowHeight integer @Height to use when spawning additional windows.
---@field private ServerMapNameOverride string @Override the map launched by the dedicated server (currently only used when in PIE_StandaloneWithServer net mode)
---@field private AdditionalServerGameOptions string @Additional options that will be passed to the server as URL parameters, in the format ?bIsLanMatch=1?listen - any additional command line switches should be passed in the Additional Server Launch Parameters field below.
---@field private AdditionalLaunchOptions string
---@field private bShowServerDebugDrawingByDefault boolean @Controls the default value of the show flag ServerDrawDebug
---@field private ServerDebugDrawingColorTintStrength number @How strongly debug drawing originating from the server will be biased towards the tint color
---@field private ServerDebugDrawingColorTint FLinearColor @Debug drawing originating from the server will be biased towards this color
---@field public AdditionalServerLaunchParameters string @Additional options that will be passed to the server as arguments, for example -debug. Only works with separate process servers.
---@field public ServerFixedFPS integer @If > 0, Tick dedicated server at a fixed frame rate. Does not impact Listen Server (use ClientFixedFPS setting). This is the target frame rate, e.g, "20" for 20fps, which will result in 1/20 second tick steps.
---@field public ClientFixedFPS TArray<integer> @If > 0, Tick clients at a fixed frame rate. Each client instance will map to an element in the list, wrapping around if num clients exceeds size of list. Includes Listen Server. This is the target frame rate, e.g, "20" for 20fps, which will result in 1/20 second tick steps.
---@field public NetworkEmulationSettings FLevelEditorPlayNetworkEmulationSettings @Customizable settings allowing to emulate latency and packetloss for game network transmissions
---@field public LastSize FIntPoint @The last known screen size for the first instance window (in pixels).
---@field public MultipleInstancePositions TArray<FIntPoint> @The last known screen positions of multiple instance windows (in pixels).
---@field public LastExecutedLaunchDevice string @The name of the last platform that the user ran a play session on.
