---@field public MaxLOD integer @Max (Lowest) LOD to evaluate to curve. Since LOD goes from 0 to high number, we call it Max. For example, if you have 3 LODs (0, 1, 2), and if you want this to work until LOD 1, type 1. Then the curve will be evaluated until LOD1, but not for LOD 2 Default value is 255
