---Commandlet for processing UE packet captures, through Oodle's training API, for generating compressed state dictionaries.
---Primary Commands:
---    - "AutoGenerateDictionaries Changelist":
---            - Iterates every directory recursively within "*Game*\Saved\Oodle\Server", and uses all capture files within each directory,
---                    to generate a dictionary stored in "*Game*\Content\Oodle", named "*Game**DirectoryName*.udic".
---            - For example, packet captures in "OrionGame\Saved\Oodle\Server\Input", will be generated into a dictionary stored in
---                    "OrionGame\Content\Oodle\OrionGameInput.udic"
---            - Each folder within "*Game*\Content\Oodle", should contain at least 100mb of packet captures.
---            - Changelist is an optional parameter than will only use upac files that contain the changelist in their filenames. If
---                    omitted, all files in the directory are used.
---Secondary/Testing Commands:
---    - "Enable":
---            - Inserts the Oodle PacketHandler into the games packet handler component list, and initializes Oodle *Engine.ini settings
---    - "MergePackets OutputFile PacketFile1,PacketFile2,PacketFileN":
---            - Takes the specified packet capture files, and merges them into a single packet capture file
---    - "MergePackets OutputFile All Directory":
---            - As above, but merges all capture files in the specified directory.
---    - "GenerateDictionary OutputFile FilenameFilter Changelist PacketFile1,PacketFile2,PacketFileN":
---            - Takes the specified packet capture files, with an optional filter for a substring of a filename and changelist filter
---                    (use "all" to ignore either of these filters), and uses them to generate a network compression dictionary
---    - "GenerateDictionary OutputFile FilenameFilter Changelist All Directory":
---            - As above, but uses all capture files in the specified directory, to generate a network compression dictionary
---    - "DebugDump OutputDirectory CaptureDirectory Changelist"
---            - Recursively iterates all .ucap files in CaptureDirectory, and converts them to Oodle-example-code compatible .bin files,
---                    in OutputDirectory
---    - "PacketInfo PacketFile":
---            - Outputs information about the packet file, such as the MB amount of data recorded, per net connection channel, and data types
---            - @@todo #JohnB: Only implement, if deciding to actually capture/track this kind of data
---@class UOodleNetworkTrainerCommandlet : UCommandlet

---@field public TrialGenerations integer @The number of generations of random packet-selection trials
---@field public bNoTrials boolean @Whether or not random-trials have been disabled
