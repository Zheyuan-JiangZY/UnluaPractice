---This is an experimental audio capture implementation which captures the final output from the master submix.
---This requires the new audiomixer (launch with "-audiomixer") and requires that your sequence can be played
---back in real-time (when rendering is disabled). If the sequence evaluation hitches the audio will become
---desynchronized due to their being more time passed in real time (platform time) than in the sequence itself.
