---MovementComponent is an abstract component class that defines functionality for moving a PrimitiveComponent (our UpdatedComponent) each tick.
---Base functionality includes:
---   - Restricting movement to a plane or axis.
---   - Utility functions for special handling of collision results (SlideAlongSurface(), ComputeSlideVector(), TwoWallAdjust()).
---   - Utility functions for moving when there may be initial penetration (SafeMoveUpdatedComponent(), ResolvePenetration()).
---   - Automatically registering the component tick and finding a component to move on the owning Actor.
---Normally the root component of the owning actor is moved, however another component may be selected (see SetUpdatedComponent()).
---During swept (non-teleporting) movement only collision of UpdatedComponent is considered, attached components will teleport to the end location ignoring collision.
---@class UMovementComponent : UActorComponent
---@field public UpdatedComponent USceneComponent @The component we move and update. If this is null at startup and bAutoRegisterUpdatedComponent is true, the owning Actor's root component will automatically be set as our UpdatedComponent at startup.
---@field public UpdatedPrimitive UPrimitiveComponent @UpdatedComponent, cast as a UPrimitiveComponent. May be invalid if UpdatedComponent was null or not a UPrimitiveComponent.
---@field public Velocity FVector @Current velocity of updated component.
---@field protected PlaneConstraintNormal FVector @The normal or axis of the plane that constrains movement, if bConstrainToPlane is enabled. If for example you wanted to constrain movement to the X-Z plane (so that Y cannot change), the normal would be set to X=0 Y=1 Z=0. This is recalculated whenever PlaneConstraintAxisSetting changes. It is normalized once the component is registered with the game world.
---@field protected PlaneConstraintOrigin FVector @The origin of the plane that constrains movement, if plane constraint is enabled. This defines the behavior of snapping a position to the plane, such as by SnapUpdatedComponentToPlane().
---@field public bUpdateOnlyIfRendered boolean @If true, skips TickComponent() if UpdatedComponent was not recently rendered.
---@field public bAutoUpdateTickRegistration boolean @If true, whenever the updated component is changed, this component will enable or disable its tick dependent on whether it has something to update. This will NOT enable tick at startup if bAutoActivate is false, because presumably you have a good reason for not wanting it to start ticking initially.
---@field public bTickBeforeOwner boolean @If true, after registration we will add a tick dependency to tick before our owner (if we can both tick). This is important when our tick causes an update in the owner's position, so that when the owner ticks it uses the most recent position without lag. Disabling this can improve performance if both objects tick but the order of ticks doesn't matter.
---@field public bAutoRegisterUpdatedComponent boolean @If true, registers the owner's Root component as the UpdatedComponent if there is not one currently assigned.
---@field public bConstrainToPlane boolean @If true, movement will be constrained to a plane.
---@field public bSnapToPlaneAtStart boolean @If true and plane constraints are enabled, then the updated component will be snapped to the plane when first attached.
---@field public bAutoRegisterPhysicsVolumeUpdates boolean @If true, then applies the value of bComponentShouldUpdatePhysicsVolume to the UpdatedComponent. If false, will not change bShouldUpdatePhysicsVolume on the UpdatedComponent at all.
---@field public bComponentShouldUpdatePhysicsVolume boolean @If true, enables bShouldUpdatePhysicsVolume on the UpdatedComponent during initialization from SetUpdatedComponent(), otherwise disables such updates. Only enabled if bAutoRegisterPhysicsVolumeUpdates is true. WARNING: UpdatePhysicsVolume is potentially expensive if overlap events are also *disabled* because it requires a separate query against all physics volumes in the world.
---@field private PlaneConstraintAxisSetting EPlaneConstraintAxisSetting @Setting that controls behavior when movement is restricted to a 2D plane defined by a specific axis/normal, so that movement along the locked axis is not be possible.

---Returns true if the current velocity is exceeding the given max speed (usually the result of GetMaxSpeed()), within a small error tolerance.
