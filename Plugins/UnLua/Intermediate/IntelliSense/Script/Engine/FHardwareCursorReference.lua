---@class FHardwareCursorReference
---@field public CursorPath string @Specify the partial game content path to the hardware cursor.  For example,   DO:   Slate/DefaultPointer   DONT: Slate/DefaultPointer.cur NOTE: Having a 'Slate' directory in your game content folder will always be cooked, if       you're trying to decide where to locate these cursor files. The hardware cursor system will search for platform specific formats first if you want to take advantage of those capabilities. Windows:   .ani -> .cur -> .png Mac:   .tiff -> .png Linux:   .png Multi-Resolution Png Fallback  Because there's not a universal multi-resolution format for cursors there's a pattern we look for  on all platforms where pngs are all that is found instead of cur/ani/tiff.    Pointer.png    Pointer@@1.25x.png    Pointer@@1.5x.png    Pointer@@1.75x.png    Pointer@@2x.png    ...etc
---@field public HotSpot FVector2D @HotSpot needs to be in normalized (0..1) coordinates since it may apply to different resolution images. NOTE: This HotSpot is only used on formats that do not provide their own hotspot, e.g. Tiff, PNG.
