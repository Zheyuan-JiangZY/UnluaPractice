---ActorComponent is the base class for components that define reusable behavior that can be added to different types of Actors.
---ActorComponents that have a transform are known as SceneComponents and those that can be rendered are PrimitiveComponents.
---@class UActorComponent : UObject
---@field public PrimaryComponentTick FActorComponentTickFunction @Main tick function for the Component
---@field public ComponentTags TArray<string> @Array of tags that can be used for grouping and categorizing. Can also be accessed from scripting.
---@field protected AssetUserData TArray<UAssetUserData> @Array of user data stored with the component
---@field private UCSSerializationIndex integer @Populated when the component is created and tracks the often used order of creation on a per archetype/per actor basis
---@field protected bNetAddressable boolean @Is this component safe to ID over the network by name?
---@field private bReplicates boolean @Is this component currently replicating? Should the network code consider it for replication? Owning Actor must be replicating first!
---@field public bAutoActivate boolean @Whether the component is activated at creation or must be explicitly activated.
---@field private bIsActive boolean @Whether the component is currently active.
---@field public bEditableWhenInherited boolean @True if this component can be modified when it was inherited from a parent actor class
---@field protected bCanEverAffectNavigation boolean @Whether this component can potentially influence navigation
---@field public bIsEditorOnly boolean @If true, the component will be excluded from non-editor builds
---@field private bIsVisualizationComponent boolean @True if this component is only used for visualization, usually a sprite or text
---@field private bNeedsUCSSerializationIndexEvaluted boolean @Marks this component pending kill once PostLoad occurs. Used to clean up old native default subobjects that were removed from code
---@field public CreationMethod EComponentCreationMethod @Describes how a component instance will be created
---@field public OnComponentActivated MulticastDelegate @Called when the component has been activated, with parameter indicating if it was from a reset
---@field public OnComponentDeactivated MulticastDelegate @Called when the component has been deactivated
---@field private UCSModifiedProperties TArray<FSimpleMemberReference>
local UActorComponent = {}

---Toggles the active state of the component
function UActorComponent:ToggleActive() end

---Changes the ticking group for this component
---@param NewTickGroup integer
function UActorComponent:SetTickGroup(NewTickGroup) end

---Sets whether this component can tick when paused.
---@param bTickableWhenPaused boolean
function UActorComponent:SetTickableWhenPaused(bTickableWhenPaused) end

---Enable or disable replication. This is the equivalent of RemoteRole for actors (only a bool is required for components)
---@param ShouldReplicate boolean
function UActorComponent:SetIsReplicated(ShouldReplicate) end

---Sets the tick interval for this component's primary tick function. Does not enable the tick interval. Takes effect imediately.
---@param TickInterval number
function UActorComponent:SetComponentTickIntervalAndCooldown(TickInterval) end

---Sets the tick interval for this component's primary tick function. Does not enable the tick interval. Takes effect on next tick.
---@param TickInterval number
function UActorComponent:SetComponentTickInterval(TickInterval) end

---Set this component's tick functions to be enabled or disabled. Only has an effect if the function is registered
---@param bEnabled boolean
function UActorComponent:SetComponentTickEnabled(bEnabled) end

---Sets whether the component should be auto activate or not. Only safe during construction scripts.
---@param bNewAutoActivate boolean
function UActorComponent:SetAutoActivate(bNewAutoActivate) end

---Sets whether the component is active or not
---@param bNewActive boolean
---@param bReset boolean @[opt] 
function UActorComponent:SetActive(bNewActive, bReset) end

---Remove tick dependency on PrerequisiteComponent.
---@param PrerequisiteComponent UActorComponent
function UActorComponent:RemoveTickPrerequisiteComponent(PrerequisiteComponent) end

---Remove tick dependency on PrerequisiteActor.
---@param PrerequisiteActor AActor
function UActorComponent:RemoveTickPrerequisiteActor(PrerequisiteActor) end

---Event called every frame if tick is enabled
---@param DeltaSeconds number
function UActorComponent:ReceiveTick(DeltaSeconds) end

---Blueprint implementable event for when the component ends play, generally via destruction or its Actor's EndPlay.
---@param EndPlayReason integer
function UActorComponent:ReceiveEndPlay(EndPlayReason) end

---Blueprint implementable event for when the component is beginning play, called before its owning actor's BeginPlay
---or when the component is dynamically created if the Actor has already BegunPlay.
function UActorComponent:ReceiveBeginPlay() end

---Handles replication of active state, handles ticking by default but should be overridden as needed
function UActorComponent:OnRep_IsActive() end

---Unregister and mark for pending kill a component.  This may not be used to destroy a component that is owned by an actor unless the owning actor is calling the function.
---@param Object UObject
function UActorComponent:K2_DestroyComponent(Object) end

---Returns whether this component has tick enabled or not
---@return boolean
function UActorComponent:IsComponentTickEnabled() end

---Returns whether the component is in the process of being destroyed.
---@return boolean
function UActorComponent:IsBeingDestroyed() end

---Returns whether the component is active or not
---@return boolean
function UActorComponent:IsActive() end

---Follow the Outer chain to get the  AActor  that 'Owns' this component
---@return AActor
function UActorComponent:GetOwner() end

---Returns the tick interval for this component's primary tick function, which is the frequency in seconds at which it will be executed
---@return number
function UActorComponent:GetComponentTickInterval() end

---Deactivates the SceneComponent.
function UActorComponent:Deactivate() end

---See if this component contains the supplied tag
---@param Tag string
---@return boolean
function UActorComponent:ComponentHasTag(Tag) end

---Make this component tick after PrerequisiteComponent.
---@param PrerequisiteComponent UActorComponent
function UActorComponent:AddTickPrerequisiteComponent(PrerequisiteComponent) end

---Make this component tick after PrerequisiteActor
---@param PrerequisiteActor AActor
function UActorComponent:AddTickPrerequisiteActor(PrerequisiteActor) end

---Activates the SceneComponent, should be overridden by native child classes.
---@param bReset boolean @[opt] 
function UActorComponent:Activate(bReset) end
