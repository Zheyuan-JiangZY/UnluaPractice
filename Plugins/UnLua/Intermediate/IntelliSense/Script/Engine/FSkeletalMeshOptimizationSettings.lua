---FSkeletalMeshOptimizationSettings - The settings used to optimize a skeletal mesh LOD.
---@class FSkeletalMeshOptimizationSettings
---@field public TerminationCriterion integer @The method to use when optimizing the skeletal mesh LOD
---@field public NumOfTrianglesPercentage number @The percentage of triangles to retain as a ratio, e.g. 0.1 indicates 10 percent
---@field public NumOfVertPercentage number @The percentage of vertices to retain as a ratio, e.g. 0.1 indicates 10 percent
---@field public MaxNumOfTriangles integer @The maximum number of triangles to retain
---@field public MaxNumOfVerts integer @The maximum number of vertices to retain
---@field public MaxNumOfTrianglesPercentage integer @The maximum number of triangles to retain when using percentage termination criterion.
---@field public MaxNumOfVertsPercentage integer @The maximum number of vertices to retain when using percentage termination criterion.
---@field public MaxDeviationPercentage number @If ReductionMethod equals MaxDeviation this value is the maximum deviation from the base mesh as a percentage of the bounding sphere. In code, it ranges from [0, 1]. In the editor UI, it ranges from [0, 100]
---@field public ReductionMethod integer @The method to use when optimizing the skeletal mesh LOD
---@field public SilhouetteImportance integer @How important the shape of the geometry is.
---@field public TextureImportance integer @How important texture density is.
---@field public ShadingImportance integer @How important shading quality is.
---@field public SkinningImportance integer @How important skinning quality is.
---@field public bRemapMorphTargets boolean @Remap the morph targets from the base LOD onto the reduce LOD.
---@field public bRecalcNormals boolean @Whether Normal smoothing groups should be preserved. If true then Hard Edge Angle (NormalsThreshold) is used *
---@field public WeldingThreshold number @The welding threshold distance. Vertices under this distance will be welded.
---@field public NormalsThreshold number @If the angle between two triangles are above this value, the normals will not be       smooth over the edge between those two triangles. Set in degrees. This is only used when bRecalcNormals is set to true
---@field public MaxBonesPerVertex integer @Maximum number of bones that can be assigned to each vertex.
---@field public bEnforceBoneBoundaries boolean @Penalize edge collapse between vertices that have different major bones.  This will help articulated segments like tongues but can lead to undesirable results under extreme simplification
---@field public VolumeImportance number @Default value of 1 attempts to preserve volume.  Smaller values will loose volume by flattening curved surfaces, and larger values will accentuate curved surfaces.
---@field public bLockEdges boolean @Preserve cuts in the mesh surface by locking vertices in place.  Increases the quality of the simplified mesh at edges at the cost of more triangles
---@field public bLockColorBounaries boolean @Disallow edge collapse when the vertices do not have a common color
---@field public BaseLOD integer @Base LOD index to generate this LOD. By default, we generate from LOD 0
