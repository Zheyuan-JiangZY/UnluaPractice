---The GameModeBase defines the game being played. It governs the game rules, scoring, what actors
---are allowed to exist in this game type, and who may enter the game.
---It is only instanced on the server and will never exist on the client.
---A GameModeBase actor is instantiated when the level is initialized for gameplay in
---C++ UGameEngine::LoadMap().
---The class of this GameMode actor is determined by (in order) either the URL ?game=xxx,
---the GameMode Override value set in the World Settings, or the DefaultGameMode entry set
---in the game's Project Settings.
