---Controllers are non-physical actors that can possess a Pawn to control
---its actions.  PlayerControllers are used by human players to control pawns, while
---AIControllers implement the artificial intelligence for the pawns they control.
---Controllers take control of a pawn using their Possess() method, and relinquish
---control of the pawn by calling UnPossess().
---Controllers receive notifications for many of the events occurring for the Pawn they
---are controlling.  This gives the controller the opportunity to implement the behavior
---in response to this event, intercepting the event and superseding the Pawn's default
---behavior.
---ControlRotation (accessed via GetControlRotation()), determines the viewing/aiming
---direction of the controlled Pawn and is affected by input such as from a mouse or gamepad.
---@class AController : AActor
---@field public PlayerState APlayerState @PlayerState containing replicated information about the player using this controller (only exists for players, not NPCs).
---@field public OnInstigatedAnyDamage MulticastDelegate @Called when the controller has instigated damage in any way
---@field public StateName string @Current gameplay state this controller is in
---@field private Pawn APawn @Pawn currently being controlled by this controller.  Use Pawn.Possess() to take control of a pawn
---@field private Character ACharacter @Character currently being controlled by this controller.  Value is same as Pawn if the controlled pawn is a character, otherwise nullptr
---@field private TransformComponent USceneComponent @Component to give controllers a transform and enable attachment if desired.
---@field protected ControlRotation FRotator @The control rotation of the Controller. See GetControlRotation.
---@field protected bAttachToPawn boolean @If true, the controller location will match the possessed Pawn's location. If false, it will not be updated. Rotation will match ControlRotation in either case. Since a Controller's location is normally inaccessible, this is intended mainly for purposes of being able to attach an Actor that follows the possessed Pawn location, but that still has the full aim rotation (since a Pawn might update only some components of the rotation).
