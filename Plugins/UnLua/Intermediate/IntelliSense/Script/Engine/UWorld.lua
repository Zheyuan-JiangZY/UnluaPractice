---The World is the top level object representing a map or a sandbox in which Actors and Components will exist and be rendered.
---A World can be a single Persistent Level with an optional list of streaming levels that are loaded and unloaded via volumes and blueprint functions
---or it can be a collection of levels organized with a World Composition.
---In a standalone game, generally only a single World exists except during seamless area transitions when both a destination and current world exists.
---In the editor many Worlds exist: The level being edited, each PIE instance, each editor tool which has an interactive rendered viewport, and many more.

---@field public PerModuleDataObjects TArray<UObject> @External modules can have additional data associated with this UWorld. This is a list of per module world data objects. These aren't loaded/saved by default.
---@field private StreamingLevels TArray<ULevelStreaming> @Level collection. ULevels are referenced by FName (Package name) to avoid serialized references. Also contains offsets in world units
---@field private StreamingLevelsToConsider FStreamingLevelsToConsider @This is the list of streaming levels that are actively being considered for what their state should be. It will be a subset of StreamingLevels
---@field public StreamingLevelsPrefix string @Prefix we used to rename streaming levels, non empty in PIE and standalone preview
---@field private CurrentLevelPendingVisibility ULevel @Pointer to the current level in the queue to be made visible, NULL if none are pending.
