---Per-object settings for Lightmass
---@class FLightmassPrimitiveSettings
---@field public bUseTwoSidedLighting boolean @If true, this object will be lit as if it receives light from both sides of its polygons.
---@field public bShadowIndirectOnly boolean @If true, this object will only shadow indirect lighting.
---@field public bUseEmissiveForStaticLighting boolean @If true, allow using the emissive for static lighting.
---@field public bUseVertexNormalForHemisphereGather boolean @Typically the triangle normal is used for hemisphere gathering which prevents incorrect self-shadowing from artist-tweaked vertex normals. However in the case of foliage whose vertex normal has been setup to match the underlying terrain, gathering in the direction of the vertex normal is desired.
---@field public EmissiveLightFalloffExponent number @Direct lighting falloff exponent for mesh area lights created from emissive areas on this primitive.
---@field public EmissiveLightExplicitInfluenceRadius number @Direct lighting influence radius. The default is 0, which means the influence radius should be automatically generated based on the emissive light brightness. Values greater than 0 override the automatic method.
---@field public EmissiveBoost number @Scales the emissive contribution of all materials applied to this object.
---@field public DiffuseBoost number @Scales the diffuse contribution of all materials applied to this object.
---@field public FullyOccludedSamplesFraction number @Fraction of samples taken that must be occluded in order to reach full occlusion.
