---Characters are Pawns that have a mesh, collision, and built-in movement logic.
---They are responsible for all physical interaction between the player or AI and the world, and also implement basic networking and input models.
---They are designed for a vertically-oriented player representation that can walk, jump, fly, and swim through the world using CharacterMovementComponent.
---@class ACharacter : APawn
---@field private Mesh USkeletalMeshComponent @The main skeletal mesh associated with this Character (optional sub-object).
---@field private CharacterMovement UCharacterMovementComponent @Movement component used for movement logic in various movement modes (walking, falling, etc), containing relevant settings and functions to control movement.
---@field private CapsuleComponent UCapsuleComponent @The CapsuleComponent being used for movement collision (by CharacterMovement). Always treated as being vertically aligned in simple collision check functions.
---@field private ArrowComponent UArrowComponent @Component shown in the editor only to indicate character facing
---@field protected BasedMovement FBasedMovementInfo @Info about our current movement base (object we are standing on).
---@field protected ReplicatedBasedMovement FBasedMovementInfo @Replicated version of relative movement. Read-only on simulated proxies!
---@field protected AnimRootMotionTranslationScale number @Scale to apply to root motion translation on this Character
---@field protected BaseTranslationOffset FVector @Saved translation offset of mesh.
---@field protected BaseRotationOffset FQuat @Saved rotation offset of mesh.
---@field protected ReplicatedServerLastTransformUpdateTimeStamp number @CharacterMovement ServerLastTransformUpdateTimeStamp value, replicated to simulated proxies.
---@field protected ReplayLastTransformUpdateTimeStamp number
---@field protected ReplicatedMovementMode integer @CharacterMovement MovementMode (and custom mode) replicated for simulated proxies. Use CharacterMovementComponent::UnpackNetworkMovementMode() to translate it.
---@field protected bInBaseReplication boolean @Flag that we are receiving replication of the based movement.
---@field public CrouchedEyeHeight number @Default crouched eye height
---@field public bIsCrouched boolean @Set by character movement to specify that this Character is currently crouched.
---@field public bProxyIsJumpForceApplied boolean @Set to indicate that this Character is currently under the force of a jump (if JumpMaxHoldTime is non-zero). IsJumpProvidingForce() handles this as well.
---@field public bPressedJump boolean @When true, player wants to jump
---@field public bClientUpdating boolean @When true, applying updates to network client (replaying saved moves for a locally controlled character)
---@field public bClientWasFalling boolean @True if Pawn was initially falling when started to replay network moves.
---@field public bClientResimulateRootMotion boolean @If server disagrees with root motion track position, client has to resimulate root motion from last AckedMove.
---@field public bClientResimulateRootMotionSources boolean @If server disagrees with root motion state, client has to resimulate root motion from last AckedMove.
---@field public bSimGravityDisabled boolean @Disable simulated gravity (set when character encroaches geometry on client, to keep him from falling through floors)
---@field public bClientCheckEncroachmentOnNetUpdate boolean
---@field public bServerMoveIgnoreRootMotion boolean @Disable root motion on the server. When receiving a DualServerMove, where the first move is not root motion and the second is.
---@field public bWasJumping boolean @Tracks whether or not the character was already jumping last frame.
---@field public JumpKeyHoldTime number @Jump key Held Time. This is the time that the player has held the jump key, in seconds.
---@field public JumpForceTimeRemaining number @Amount of jump force time remaining, if JumpMaxHoldTime > 0.
---@field public ProxyJumpForceStartedTime number @Track last time a jump force started for a proxy.
---@field public JumpMaxHoldTime number @The max time the jump key can be held. Note that if StopJumping() is not called before the max jump hold time is reached, then the character will carry on receiving vertical velocity. Therefore it is usually best to call StopJumping() when jump input has ceased (such as a button up event).
---@field public JumpMaxCount integer @The max number of jumps the character can perform. Note that if JumpMaxHoldTime is non zero and StopJumping is not called, the player may be able to perform and unlimited number of jumps. Therefore it is usually best to call StopJumping() when jump input has ceased (such as a button up event).
---@field public JumpCurrentCount integer @Tracks the current number of jumps performed. This is incremented in CheckJumpInput, used in CanJump_Implementation, and reset in OnMovementModeChanged. When providing overrides for these methods, it's recommended to either manually increment / reset this value, or call the Super:: method.
---@field public JumpCurrentCountPreJump integer @Represents the current number of jumps performed before CheckJumpInput modifies JumpCurrentCount. This is set in CheckJumpInput and is used in SetMoveFor and PrepMoveFor instead of JumpCurrentCount since CheckJumpInput can modify JumpCurrentCount. When providing overrides for these methods, it's recommended to either manually set this value, or call the Super:: method.
---@field public OnReachedJumpApex MulticastDelegate @Broadcast when Character's jump reaches its apex. Needs CharacterMovement->bNotifyApex = true
---@field public MovementModeChangedDelegate MulticastDelegate @Multicast delegate for MovementMode changing.
---@field public OnCharacterMovementUpdated MulticastDelegate @Event triggered at the end of a CharacterMovementComponent movement update. This is the preferred event to use rather than the Tick event when performing custom updates to CharacterMovement properties based on the current state. This is mainly due to the nature of network updates, where client corrections in position from the server can cause multiple iterations of a movement update, which allows this event to update as well, while a Tick event would not.
---@field public SavedRootMotion FRootMotionSourceGroup @For LocallyControlled Autonomous clients. During a PerformMovement() after root motion is prepared, we save it off into this and then record it into our SavedMoves. During SavedMove playback we use it as our "Previous Move" SavedRootMotion which includes last received root motion from the Server
---@field public ClientRootMotionParams FRootMotionMovementParams @For LocallyControlled Autonomous clients. Saved root motion data to be used by SavedMoves.
---@field public RootMotionRepMoves TArray<FSimulatedRootMotionReplicatedMove> @Array of previously received root motion moves from the server.
---@field public RepRootMotion FRepRootMotionMontage @Replicated Root Motion montage
