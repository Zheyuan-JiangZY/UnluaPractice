---* Base class for attenuation settings.
---@class FBaseAttenuationSettings
---@field public DistanceAlgorithm EAttenuationDistanceModel @The type of attenuation as a function of distance to use.
---@field public AttenuationShape integer @The shape of the non-custom attenuation method.
---@field public dBAttenuationAtMax number @The attenuation volume at the falloff distance in decibels (Only for 'Natural Sound' Distance Algorithm).
---@field public FalloffMode ENaturalSoundFalloffMode @Whether to continue attenuating, go silent, or hold last volume value when beyond falloff bounds and 'Attenuation At Max (dB)' is set to a value greater than -60dB. (Only for 'Natural Sound' Distance Algorithm). */
---@field public AttenuationShapeExtents FVector @The dimensions to use for the attenuation shape. Interpretation of the values differ per shape.          Sphere  - X is Sphere Radius. Y and Z are unused          Capsule - X is Capsule Half Height, Y is Capsule Radius, Z is unused          Box     - X, Y, and Z are the Box's dimensions          Cone    - X is Cone Radius, Y is Cone Angle, Z is Cone Falloff Angle
---@field public ConeOffset number @The distance back from the sound's origin to begin the cone when using the cone attenuation shape.
---@field public FalloffDistance number @The distance over which volume attenuation occurs.
---@field public CustomAttenuationCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @The custom volume attenuation curve to use.
