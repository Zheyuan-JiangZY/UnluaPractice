---Settings applied when building a mesh.
---@class FSkeletalMeshBuildSettings
---@field public bRecomputeNormals boolean @If true, normals in the raw mesh are ignored and recomputed.
---@field public bRecomputeTangents boolean @If true, tangents in the raw mesh are ignored and recomputed.
---@field public bUseMikkTSpace boolean @If true, degenerate triangles will be removed.
---@field public bComputeWeightedNormals boolean @If true, we will use the surface area and the corner angle of the triangle as a ratio when computing the normals.
---@field public bRemoveDegenerates boolean @If true, degenerate triangles will be removed.
---@field public bUseHighPrecisionTangentBasis boolean @If true, Tangents will be stored at 16 bit vs 8 bit precision.
---@field public bUseFullPrecisionUVs boolean @If true, UVs will be stored at full floating point precision.
---@field public bBuildAdjacencyBuffer boolean @Required for PNT tessellation but can be slow. Recommend disabling for larger meshes.
---@field public ThresholdPosition number @Threshold use to decide if two vertex position are equal.
---@field public ThresholdTangentNormal number @Threshold use to decide if two normal, tangents or bi-normals are equal.
---@field public ThresholdUV number @Threshold use to decide if two UVs are equal.
---@field public MorphThresholdPosition number @Threshold to compare vertex position equality when computing morph target deltas.
