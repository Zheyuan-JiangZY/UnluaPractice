---AudioComponent is used to play a Sound
---@class UAudioComponent : USceneComponent
---@field public Sound USoundBase @The sound to be played
---@field public InstanceParameters TArray<FAudioComponentParam> @Array of per-instance parameters for this AudioComponent.
---@field public SoundClassOverride USoundClass @Optional sound group this AudioComponent belongs to
---@field public bAutoDestroy boolean @Auto destroy this component on completion
---@field public bStopWhenOwnerDestroyed boolean @Stop sound when owner is destroyed
---@field public bShouldRemainActiveIfDropped boolean @Whether the wave instances should remain active if they're dropped by the prioritization code. Useful for e.g. vehicle sounds that shouldn't cut out.
---@field public bAllowSpatialization boolean @Overrides spatialization enablement in either the attenuation asset or on this audio component's attenuation settings override.
---@field public bOverrideAttenuation boolean @Allows defining attenuation settings directly on this audio component without using an attenuation settings asset.
---@field public bOverrideSubtitlePriority boolean @Whether or not to override the sound's subtitle priority.
---@field public bIsUISound boolean @Whether or not this sound plays when the game is paused in the UI
---@field public bEnableLowPassFilter boolean @Whether or not to apply a low-pass filter to the sound that plays in this audio component.
---@field public bOverridePriority boolean
---@field public bSuppressSubtitles boolean @If true, subtitles in the sound data will be ignored.
---@field public bAutoManageAttachment boolean @True if we should automatically attach to AutoAttachParent when Played, and detach from our parent when playback is completed. This overrides any current attachment that may be present at the time of activation (deferring initial attachment until activation, if AutoAttachParent is null). If enabled, this AudioComponent's WorldLocation will no longer be reliable when not currently playing audio, and any attach children will also be detached/attached along with it. When enabled, detachment occurs regardless of whether AutoAttachParent is assigned, and the relative transform from the time of activation is restored. This also disables attachment on dedicated servers, where we don't actually activate even if bAutoActivate is true.
