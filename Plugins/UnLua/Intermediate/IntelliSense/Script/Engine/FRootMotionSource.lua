---Generalized source of Root Motion to a CharacterMovementComponent.
---Has priorities and different accumulation modes (override, additive, set, ignore).
---RootMotionSources are accumulated from highest priority to lowest, once all values
---are "finalized" (meaning no more accumulation to those values), root motion accumulation
---is finished. Having all of translation and rotation in a transform being overridden during
---root motion accumulation means that CharacterMovementComponent Phys*() functions no longer
---need to CalcVelocity() since it'll just get overridden anyway.
---Some example source possibilities:
---        Full Animation Root Motion (matching only form of root motion we've supported historically):
---                - Overrides all translation axes or rotation or both
---                - Very High priority so it gets applied first and since it is override no other
---                  RootMotionSources have an influence that are lower priority
---                - Scale on translation and/or rotation is set to 1 to match animation 1 for 1
---                - Provides local space transform (character-orientation relative)
---                - End result: Same as before - overrides velocity/rotation to values in AnimMontage
---                - But can now scale individual translation axes if desired, or instead of override
---                  can use "set" to allow other additive sources of root motion to be applied on top
---                  of the animation root motion (modify velocity to home root motion melee attacks, etc.)
---        Jump pad volumes that work during animation root montage attacks
---                - Constant velocity modification Z up, additive and high priority
---                - Attack/melee animation root motion uses "set" instead of "override" to allow other sources
---                - Animation root motion is applied, then the Z up additive of this source is so you are
---                  affected by the jump pad
---        Attack/melee homing
---                - Additive, lower priority so it gets applied after any animation/significant root motion
---                - World space, sourced by logic modifying velocity to go towards nearby enemies
---                - Could point to a UAbilityTask node from the GameplayAbilities system
---        Character movement controlled by splines/curves in-editor instead of requiring animation tweaks
---                - Same as animation root motion but source from spline/curve data
---@class FRootMotionSource
---@field public Priority integer @Priority of this source relative to other sources - higher number being the highest priority/first applied.
---@field public LocalID integer @ID local to this client or server instance. Used for matching up FRootMotionSources between SavedMoves and allow a mapping between server LocalIDs and client LocalIDs for correction/comparison
---@field public AccumulateMode ERootMotionAccumulateMode @Accumulation mode for this source (whether or not to additively apply this root motion or override completely)
---@field public InstanceName string @This name allows us to find the source later so that we can end it.
---@field public StartTime number @Time this source should start (in character movement client time) This is used to handle cases of inconsistent tick times (ServerMoves ticking for 1 second when root motion should have only applied for the last 0.1 seconds, or root motion source ending halfway through a 0.5 second tick)
---@field public CurrentTime number @Time elapsed so far for this source
---@field public PreviousTime number @The last Time entry we had before the last SetTime() - used for simulated catchup
---@field public Duration number @The length of this root motion - < 0 for infinite (to be removed manually)
---@field public Status FRootMotionSourceStatus @Status of this source
---@field public Settings FRootMotionSourceSettings @Settings of this source
---@field public bInLocalSpace boolean @True when this RootMotionSource is contributing local space accumulation (false for world space)
---@field public RootMotionParams FRootMotionMovementParams @Root Motion generated by this Source
---@field public FinishVelocityParams FRootMotionFinishVelocitySettings @Finish Velocity Parameters
