---Container for a physics representation of an object.
---@class FConstraintInstance : FConstraintInstanceBase
---@field public JointName string @Name of bone that this joint is associated with.
---@field public ConstraintBone1 string @Name of first bone (body) that this constraint is connecting. This will be the 'child' bone in a PhysicsAsset.
---@field public ConstraintBone2 string @Name of second bone (body) that this constraint is connecting. This will be the 'parent' bone in a PhysicsAset.
---@field public Pos1 FVector @Location of constraint in Body1 reference frame (usually the "child" body for skeletal meshes).
---@field public PriAxis1 FVector @Primary (twist) axis in Body1 reference frame.
---@field public SecAxis1 FVector @Seconday axis in Body1 reference frame. Orthogonal to PriAxis1.
---@field public Pos2 FVector @Location of constraint in Body2 reference frame (usually the "parent" body for skeletal meshes).
---@field public PriAxis2 FVector @Primary (twist) axis in Body2 reference frame.
---@field public SecAxis2 FVector @Seconday axis in Body2 reference frame. Orthogonal to PriAxis2.
---@field public AngularRotationOffset FRotator @Specifies the angular offset between the two frames of reference. By default limit goes from (-Angle, +Angle) This allows you to bias the limit for swing1 swing2 and twist.
---@field public bScaleLinearLimits boolean @If true, linear limits scale using the absolute min of the 3d scale of the owning component
---@field public ProfileInstance FConstraintProfileProperties @Constraint Data (properties easily swapped at runtime based on different constraint profiles)
local FConstraintInstance = {}
