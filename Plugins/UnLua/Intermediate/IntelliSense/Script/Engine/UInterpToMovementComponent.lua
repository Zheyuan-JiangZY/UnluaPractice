---Move the root component between a series of points over a given time *
---@class UInterpToMovementComponent : UMovementComponent
---@field public Duration number @How long to take to move from the first point to the last (or vice versa)
---@field public bPauseOnImpact boolean @If true, will pause movement on impact. If false it will behave as if the end of the movement range was reached based on the BehaviourType.
---@field public bSweep boolean @If true, will sweep for blocking collision during movement. If false, it will simply teleport to the next position and ignore collision.
---@field public TeleportType ETeleportType @Physics teleport type.
---@field public BehaviourType EInterpToBehaviourType @Movement behaviour of the component
---@field public bCheckIfStillInWorld boolean @Do we want this comp to perform CheckStillInWorld checks?
---@field public bForceSubStepping boolean @If true, forces sub-stepping to break up movement into discrete smaller steps to improve accuracy of the trajectory. Objects that move in a straight line typically do *not* need to set this, as movement always uses continuous collision detection (sweeps) so collision is not missed. Sub-stepping is automatically enabled when under the effects of gravity or when homing towards a target.
---@field public OnInterpToReverse MulticastDelegate @Called when InterpTo impacts something and reverse is enabled.
---@field public OnInterpToStop MulticastDelegate @Called when InterpTo has come to a stop.
---@field public OnWaitBeginDelegate MulticastDelegate @Called when InterpTo has come to a stop but will resume when possible.
---@field public OnWaitEndDelegate MulticastDelegate @Called when InterpTo has resumed following a stop.
---@field public OnResetDelegate MulticastDelegate @Called when InterpTo reached the end and reset back to start .
---@field public MaxSimulationTimeStep number @Max time delta for each discrete simulation step. Lowering this value can address issues with fast-moving objects or complex collision scenarios, at the cost of performance. WARNING: if (MaxSimulationTimeStep * MaxSimulationIterations) is too low for the min framerate, the last simulation step may exceed MaxSimulationTimeStep to complete the simulation.
---@field public MaxSimulationIterations integer @Max number of iterations used for each discrete simulation step. Increasing this value can address issues with fast-moving objects or complex collision scenarios, at the cost of performance. WARNING: if (MaxSimulationTimeStep * MaxSimulationIterations) is too low for the min framerate, the last simulation step may exceed MaxSimulationTimeStep to complete the simulation.
