---Font import options
---@class FFontImportOptionsData
---@field public FontName string @Name of the typeface for the font to import
---@field public Height number @Height of font (point size)
---@field public bEnableAntialiasing boolean @Whether the font should be antialiased or not.  Usually you should leave this enabled.
---@field public bEnableBold boolean @Whether the font should be generated in bold or not
---@field public bEnableItalic boolean @Whether the font should be generated in italics or not
---@field public bEnableUnderline boolean @Whether the font should be generated with an underline or not
---@field public bAlphaOnly boolean @if true then forces PF_G8 and only maintains Alpha value and discards color
---@field public CharacterSet integer @Character set for this font
---@field public Chars string @Explicit list of characters to include in the font
---@field public UnicodeRange string @Range of Unicode character values to include in the font.  You can specify ranges using hyphens and/or commas (e.g. '400-900')
---@field public CharsFilePath string @Path on disk to a folder where files that contain a list of characters to include in the font
---@field public CharsFileWildcard string @File mask wildcard that specifies which files within the CharsFilePath to scan for characters in include in the font
---@field public bCreatePrintableOnly boolean @Skips generation of glyphs for any characters that are not considered 'printable'
---@field public bIncludeASCIIRange boolean @When specifying a range of characters and this is enabled, forces ASCII characters (0 thru 255) to be included as well
---@field public ForegroundColor FLinearColor @Color of the foreground font pixels.  Usually you should leave this white and instead use the UI Styles editor to change the color of the font on the fly
---@field public bEnableDropShadow boolean @Enables a very simple, 1-pixel, black colored drop shadow for the generated font
---@field public TexturePageWidth integer @Horizontal size of each texture page for this font in pixels
---@field public TexturePageMaxHeight integer @The maximum vertical size of a texture page for this font in pixels.  The actual height of a texture page may be less than this if the font can fit within a smaller sized texture page.
---@field public XPadding integer @Horizontal padding between each font character on the texture page in pixels
---@field public YPadding integer @Vertical padding between each font character on the texture page in pixels
---@field public ExtendBoxTop integer @How much to extend the top of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels
---@field public ExtendBoxBottom integer @How much to extend the bottom of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels
---@field public ExtendBoxRight integer @How much to extend the right of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels
---@field public ExtendBoxLeft integer @How much to extend the left of the UV coordinate rectangle for each character in pixels
---@field public bEnableLegacyMode boolean @Enables legacy font import mode.  This results in lower quality antialiasing and larger glyph bounds, but may be useful when debugging problems
---@field public Kerning integer @The initial horizontal spacing adjustment between rendered characters.  This setting will be copied directly into the generated Font object's properties.
---@field public bUseDistanceFieldAlpha boolean @If true then the alpha channel of the font textures will store a distance field instead of a color mask
---@field public DistanceFieldScaleFactor integer @Scale factor determines how big to scale the font bitmap during import when generating distance field values Note that higher values give better quality but importing will take much longer.
---@field public DistanceFieldScanRadiusScale number @Shrinks or expands the scan radius used to determine the silhouette of the font edges.
