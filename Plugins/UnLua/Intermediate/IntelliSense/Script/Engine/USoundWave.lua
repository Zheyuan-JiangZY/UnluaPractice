---@class USoundWave : USoundBase
---@field public CompressionQuality integer @Platform agnostic compression quality. 1..100 with 1 being best compression and 100 being best quality.
---@field public StreamingPriority integer @Priority of this sound when streaming (lower priority streams may not always play)
---@field public SampleRateQuality ESoundwaveSampleRateSettings @Quality of sample rate conversion for platforms that opt into resampling during cook. The sample rate for each enumeration is definable per platform in platform target settings.
---@field public SoundGroup integer
---@field public bLooping boolean @If set, when played directly (not through a sound cue) the wave will be played looping.
---@field public bStreaming boolean @Whether this sound can be streamed to avoid increased memory usage. If using Stream Caching, use Loading Behavior instead to control memory usage.
---@field public bSeekableStreaming boolean @Whether this sound supports seeking. This requires recooking with a codec which supports seekability and streaming.
---@field public LoadingBehavior ESoundWaveLoadingBehavior @Specifies how and when compressed audio data is loaded for asset if stream caching is enabled.
---@field public bMature boolean @If set to true if this sound is considered to contain mature/adult content.
---@field public bManualWordWrap boolean @If set to true will disable automatic generation of line breaks - use if the subtitles have been split manually.
---@field public bSingleLine boolean @If set to true the subtitles display as a sequence of single lines as opposed to multiline.
---@field public bIsAmbisonics boolean @Whether or not this source is ambisonics file format. If set, sound always uses the 'Master Ambisonics Submix' as set in the 'Audio' category of Project Settings' and ignores submix if provided locally or in the referenced SoundClass.
---@field public OverrideSoundToUseForAnalysis USoundWave @Specify a sound to use for the baked analysis. Will default to this USoundWave if not set.
---@field public TreatFileAsLoopingForAnalysis boolean @Whether or not we should treat the sound wave used for analysis (this or the override) as looping while performing analysis. A looping sound may include the end of the file for inclusion in analysis for envelope and FFT analysis.
---@field public bEnableBakedFFTAnalysis boolean @Whether or not to enable cook-time baked FFT analysis.
---@field public bEnableAmplitudeEnvelopeAnalysis boolean @Whether or not to enable cook-time amplitude envelope analysis.
---@field public FFTSize ESoundWaveFFTSize @The FFT window size to use for fft analysis.
---@field public FFTAnalysisFrameSize integer @How many audio frames analyze at a time.
---@field public FFTAnalysisAttackTime integer @Attack time in milliseconds of the spectral envelope follower.
---@field public FFTAnalysisReleaseTime integer @Release time in milliseconds of the spectral envelope follower.
---@field public EnvelopeFollowerFrameSize integer @How many audio frames to average a new envelope value. Larger values use less memory for audio envelope data but will result in lower envelope accuracy.
---@field public EnvelopeFollowerAttackTime integer @The attack time in milliseconds. Describes how quickly the envelope analyzer responds to increasing amplitudes.
---@field public EnvelopeFollowerReleaseTime integer @The release time in milliseconds. Describes how quickly the envelope analyzer responds to decreasing amplitudes.
---@field public ModulationSettings FSoundModulationDefaultRoutingSettings @Modulation Settings
---@field public FrequenciesToAnalyze TArray<number> @The frequencies (in hz) to analyze when doing baked FFT analysis.
---@field public CookedSpectralTimeData TArray<FSoundWaveSpectralTimeData> @The cooked spectral time data.
---@field public CookedEnvelopeTimeData TArray<FSoundWaveEnvelopeTimeData> @The cooked cooked envelope data.
---@field public InitialChunkSize integer @Use this to override how much audio data is loaded when this USoundWave is loaded.
---@field public SpokenText string @A localized version of the text that is actually spoken phonetically in the audio.
---@field public SubtitlePriority number @The priority of the subtitle.
---@field public Volume number @Playback volume of sound 0 to 1 - Default is 1.0.
---@field public Pitch number @Playback pitch for sound.
---@field public NumChannels integer @Number of channels of multichannel data; 1 or 2 for regular mono and stereo files
---@field public ChannelOffsets TArray<integer> @Offsets into the bulk data for the source wav data
---@field public ChannelSizes TArray<integer> @Sizes of the bulk data for the source wav data
---@field protected SampleRate integer @Cached sample rate for displaying in the tools
---@field public Subtitles TArray<FSubtitleCue> @Subtitle cues.  If empty, use SpokenText as the subtitle.  Will often be empty, as the contents of the subtitle is commonly identical to what is spoken.
---@field public Comment string @Provides contextual information for the sound to the translator.
---@field public AssetImportData UAssetImportData
---@field protected Curves UCurveTable @Curves associated with this sound wave
---@field protected InternalCurves UCurveTable @Hold a reference to our internal curve so we can switch back to it if we want to
