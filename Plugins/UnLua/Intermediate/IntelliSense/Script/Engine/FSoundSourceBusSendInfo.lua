---@class FSoundSourceBusSendInfo
---@field public SourceBusSendLevelControlMethod ESourceBusSendLevelControlMethod @Manual: Use Send Level only Linear: Interpolate between Min and Max Send Levels based on listener distance (between Distance Min and Distance Max) Custom Curve: Use the float curve to map Send Level to distance (0.0-1.0 on curve maps to Distance Min - Distance Max)
---@field public SoundSourceBus USoundSourceBus @A source Bus to send the audio to. Source buses sonify (make audible) the audio sent to it and are themselves sounds which take up a voice slot in the audio engine.
---@field public AudioBus UAudioBus @An audio bus to send the audio to. Audio buses can be used to route audio to DSP effects or other purposes. E.g. side-chaining, analysis, etc. Audio buses are not audible unless hooked up to a source bus.
---@field public SendLevel number @The amount of audio to send to the bus.
---@field public MinSendLevel number @The amount to send to the bus when sound is located at a distance equal to value specified in the min send distance.
---@field public MaxSendLevel number @The amount to send to the bus when sound is located at a distance equal to value specified in the max send distance.
---@field public MinSendDistance number @The distance at which the min send Level is sent to the bus
---@field public MaxSendDistance number @The distance at which the max send level is sent to the bus
---@field public CustomSendLevelCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @The custom curve to use for distance-based bus send level.
