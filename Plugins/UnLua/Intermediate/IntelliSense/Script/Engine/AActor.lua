---Actor is the base class for an Object that can be placed or spawned in a level.
---Actors may contain a collection of ActorComponents, which can be used to control how actors move, how they are rendered, etc.
---The other main function of an Actor is the replication of properties and function calls across the network during play.
---Actor initialization has multiple steps, here's the order of important virtual functions that get called:
---- UObject::PostLoad: For actors statically placed in a level, the normal UObject PostLoad gets called both in the editor and during gameplay.
---                     This is not called for newly spawned actors.
---- UActorComponent::OnComponentCreated: When an actor is spawned in the editor or during gameplay, this gets called for any native components.
---                                       For blueprint-created components, this gets called during construction for that component.
---                                       This is not called for components loaded from a level.
---- AActor::PreRegisterAllComponents: For statically placed actors and spawned actors that have native root components, this gets called now.
---                                    For blueprint actors without a native root component, these registration functions get called later during construction.
---- UActorComponent::RegisterComponent: All components are registered in editor and at runtime, this creates their physical/visual representation.
---                                      These calls may be distributed over multiple frames, but are always after PreRegisterAllComponents.
---                                      This may also get called later on after an UnregisterComponent call removes it from the world.
---- AActor::PostRegisterAllComponents: Called for all actors both in the editor and in gameplay, this is the last function that is called in all cases.
---- AActor::PostActorCreated: When an actor is created in the editor or during gameplay, this gets called right before construction.
---                            This is not called for components loaded from a level.
---- AActor::UserConstructionScript: Called for blueprints that implement a construction script.
---- AActor::OnConstruction: Called at the end of ExecuteConstruction, which calls the blueprint construction script.
---                          This is called after all blueprint-created components are fully created and registered.
---                          This is only called during gameplay for spawned actors, and may get rerun in the editor when changing blueprints.
---- AActor::PreInitializeComponents: Called before InitializeComponent is called on the actor's components.
---                                   This is only called during gameplay and in certain editor preview windows.
---- UActorComponent::Activate: This will be called only if the component has bAutoActivate set.
---                             It will also got called later on if a component is manually activated.
---- UActorComponent::InitializeComponent: This will be called only if the component has bWantsInitializeComponentSet.
---                                        This only happens once per gameplay session.
---- AActor::PostInitializeComponents: Called after the actor's components have been initialized, only during gameplay and some editor previews.
---- AActor::BeginPlay: Called when the level starts ticking, only during actual gameplay.
---                     This normally happens right after PostInitializeComponents but can be delayed for networked or child actors.
---@class AActor : UObject
---@field public PrimaryActorTick FActorTickFunction @Primary Actor tick function, which calls TickActor(). Tick functions can be configured to control whether ticking is enabled, at what time during a frame the update occurs, and to set up tick dependencies.
---@field public bNetTemporary boolean @If true, when the actor is spawned it will be sent to the client but receive no further replication updates from the server afterwards.
---@field public bNetStartup boolean @If true, this actor was loaded directly from the map, and for networking purposes can be addressed by its full path name
---@field public bOnlyRelevantToOwner boolean @If true, this actor is only relevant to its owner. If this flag is changed during play, all non-owner channels would need to be explicitly closed.
---@field public bAlwaysRelevant boolean @Always relevant for network (overrides bOnlyRelevantToOwner).
---@field private bReplicateMovement boolean @If true, replicate movement/location related properties. Actor must also be set to replicate.
---@field private bHidden boolean @Allows us to only see this Actor in the Editor, and not in the actual game.
---@field private bTearOff boolean
---@field private bForceNetAddressable boolean @When set, indicates that external guarantees ensure that this actor's name is deterministic between server and client, and as such can be addressed by its full path
---@field public bExchangedRoles boolean @Whether we have already exchanged Role/RemoteRole on the client, as when removing then re-adding a streaming level. Causes all initialization to be performed again even though the actor may not have actually been reloaded.
---@field public bNetLoadOnClient boolean @This actor will be loaded on network clients during map load
---@field public bNetUseOwnerRelevancy boolean @If actor has valid Owner, call Owner's IsNetRelevantFor and GetNetPriority
---@field public bRelevantForNetworkReplays boolean @If true, this actor will be replicated to network replays (default is true)
---@field public bRelevantForLevelBounds boolean @If true, this actor's component's bounds will be included in the level's bounding box unless the Actor's class has overridden IsLevelBoundsRelevant
---@field public bReplayRewindable boolean @If true, this actor will only be destroyed during scrubbing if the replay is set to a time before the actor existed. Otherwise, RewindForReplay will be called if we detect the actor needs to be reset. Note, this Actor must not be destroyed by gamecode, and RollbackViaDeletion may not be used.
---@field public bAllowTickBeforeBeginPlay boolean @Whether we allow this Actor to tick before it receives the BeginPlay event. Normally we don't tick actors until after BeginPlay; this setting allows this behavior to be overridden. This Actor must be able to tick for this setting to be relevant.
---@field private bAutoDestroyWhenFinished boolean @If true then destroy self when "finished", meaning all relevant components report that they are done and no timelines or timers are in flight.
---@field private bCanBeDamaged boolean @Whether this actor can take damage. Must be true for damage events (e.g. ReceiveDamage()) to be called.
---@field public bBlockInput boolean @If true, all input on the stack below this actor will not be considered
---@field public bCollideWhenPlacing boolean @This actor collides with the world when placing in the editor, even if RootComponent collision is disabled. Does not affect spawning, @@see SpawnCollisionHandlingMethod
---@field public bFindCameraComponentWhenViewTarget boolean @If true, this actor should search for an owned camera component to view through when used as a view target.
---@field public bGenerateOverlapEventsDuringLevelStreaming boolean @If true, this actor will generate overlap Begin/End events when spawned as part of level streaming, which includes initial level load. You might enable this is in the case where a streaming level loads around an actor and you want Begin/End overlap events to trigger.
---@field public bIgnoresOriginShifting boolean @Whether this actor should not be affected by world origin shifting.
---@field public bEnableAutoLODGeneration boolean @If true, and if World setting has bEnableHierarchicalLOD equal to true, then it will generate LODActor from groups of clustered Actor
---@field public bIsEditorOnlyActor boolean @Whether this actor is editor-only. Use with care, as if this actor is referenced by anything else that reference will be NULL in cooked builds
---@field public bActorSeamlessTraveled boolean @Indicates the actor was pulled through a seamless travel.
---@field protected bReplicates boolean @If true, this actor will replicate to remote machines
---@field protected bCanBeInCluster boolean @If true, this actor can be put inside of a GC Cluster to improve Garbage Collection performance
---@field protected bAllowReceiveTickEventOnDedicatedServer boolean @If false, the Blueprint ReceiveTick() event will be disabled on dedicated servers.
---@field private bActorEnableCollision boolean @Enables any collision on this actor.
---@field private bActorIsBeingDestroyed boolean @Set when actor is about to be deleted. Needs to be a FProperty so it is included in transactions.
---@field protected UpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming EActorUpdateOverlapsMethod @Condition for calling UpdateOverlaps() to initialize overlap state when loaded in during level streaming. If set to 'UseConfigDefault', the default specified in ini (displayed in 'DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming') will be used. If overlaps are not initialized, this actor and attached components will not have an initial state of what objects are touching it, and overlap events may only come in once one of those objects update overlaps themselves (for example when moving). However if an object touching it *does* initialize state, both objects will know about their touching state with each other. This can be a potentially large performance savings during level loading and streaming, and is safe if the object and others initially overlapping it do not need the overlap state because they will not trigger overlap notifications. Note that if 'bGenerateOverlapEventsDuringLevelStreaming' is true, overlaps are always updated in this case, but that flag determines whether the Begin/End overlap events are triggered.
---@field private DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming EActorUpdateOverlapsMethod @Default value taken from config file for this class when 'UseConfigDefault' is chosen for 'UpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming'. This allows a default to be chosen per class in the matching config. For example, for Actor it could be specified in DefaultEngine.ini as: [/Script/Engine.Actor] DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming = OnlyUpdateMovable Another subclass could set their default to something different, such as: [/Script/Engine.BlockingVolume] DefaultUpdateOverlapsMethodDuringLevelStreaming = NeverUpdate
