---A PlayerCameraManager is responsible for managing the camera for a particular
---player. It defines the final view properties used by other systems (e.g. the renderer),
---meaning you can think of it as your virtual eyeball in the world. It can compute the
---final camera properties directly, or it can arbitrate/blend between other objects or
---actors that influence the camera (e.g. blending from one CameraActor to another).
---The PlayerCameraManagers primary external responsibility is to reliably respond to
---various Get*() functions, such as GetCameraViewPoint. Most everything else is
---implementation detail and overrideable by user projects.
---By default, a PlayerCameraManager maintains a "view target", which is the primary actor
---the camera is associated with. It can also apply various "post" effects to the final
---view state, such as camera animations, shakes, post-process effects or special
---effects such as dirt on the lens.

---@field public DefaultFOV number @FOV to use by default.
---@field public DefaultOrthoWidth number @The default desired width (in world units) of the orthographic view (ignored in Perspective mode)

---@field protected CachedCameraShakeMod UCameraModifier_CameraShake @Cached ref to modifier for code-driven screen shakes

---@field public bIsOrthographic boolean @True when this camera should use an orthographic perspective instead of FOV
---@field public bDefaultConstrainAspectRatio boolean @True if black bars should be added if the destination view has a different aspect ratio (only used when a view target doesn't specify whether or not to constrain the aspect ratio; most of the time the value from a camera component is used instead)
---@field public bClientSimulatingViewTarget boolean @True if clients are handling setting their own viewtarget and the server should not replicate it (e.g. during certain Matinee sequences)
---@field public bUseClientSideCameraUpdates boolean @True if server will use camera positions replicated from the client instead of calculating them locally.
---@field public bGameCameraCutThisFrame boolean @True if we did a camera cut this frame. Automatically reset to false every frame. This flag affects various things in the renderer (such as whether to use the occlusion queries from last frame, and motion blur).
