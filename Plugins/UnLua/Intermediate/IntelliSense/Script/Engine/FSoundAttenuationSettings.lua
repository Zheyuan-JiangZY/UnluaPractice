---The settings for attenuating.
---@class FSoundAttenuationSettings : FBaseAttenuationSettings
---@field public bAttenuate boolean @Allows distance-based volume attenuation.
---@field public bSpatialize boolean @Allows the source to be 3D spatialized.
---@field public bAttenuateWithLPF boolean @Allows simulation of air absorption by applying a filter with a cutoff frequency as a function of distance.
---@field public bEnableListenerFocus boolean @Enable listener focus-based adjustments.
---@field public bEnableFocusInterpolation boolean @Enables focus interpolation to smooth transition in and and of focus.
---@field public bEnableOcclusion boolean @Enables realtime occlusion tracing.
---@field public bUseComplexCollisionForOcclusion boolean @Enables tracing against complex collision when doing occlusion traces.
---@field public bEnableReverbSend boolean @Enables adjusting reverb sends based on distance.
---@field public bEnablePriorityAttenuation boolean @Enables attenuation of sound priority based off distance.
---@field public bApplyNormalizationToStereoSounds boolean @Enables applying a -6 dB attenuation to stereo assets which are 3d spatialized. Avoids clipping when assets have spread of 0.0 due to channel summing.
---@field public bEnableLogFrequencyScaling boolean @Enables applying a log scale to frequency values (so frequency sweeping is perceptually linear).
---@field public bEnableSubmixSends boolean @Enables submix sends based on distance.
---@field public SpatializationAlgorithm integer @What method we use to spatialize the sound.
---@field public BinauralRadius number @What min radius to use to swap to non-binaural audio when a sound starts playing.
---@field public AbsorptionMethod EAirAbsorptionMethod @What method to use to map distance values to frequency absorption values.
---@field public OcclusionTraceChannel integer @Which trace channel to use for audio occlusion checks.
---@field public ReverbSendMethod EReverbSendMethod @What method to use to control master reverb sends
---@field public PriorityAttenuationMethod EPriorityAttenuationMethod @What method to use to control priority attenuation
---@field public OmniRadius number @The distance below which a sound is non-spatialized (2D). This prevents near-field audio from flipping as audio crosses the listener's position.
---@field public StereoSpread number @The world-space distance between left and right stereo channels when stereo assets are 3D spatialized.
---@field public LPFRadiusMin number @The distance min range at which to apply an absorption LPF filter.
---@field public LPFRadiusMax number @The max distance range at which to apply an absorption LPF filter. Absorption freq cutoff interpolates between filter frequency ranges between these distance values.
---@field public CustomLowpassAirAbsorptionCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @The normalized custom curve to use for the air absorption lowpass frequency values. Does a mapping from defined distance values (x-axis) and defined frequency values (y-axis)
---@field public CustomHighpassAirAbsorptionCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @The normalized custom curve to use for the air absorption highpass frequency values. Does a mapping from defined distance values (x-axis) and defined frequency values (y-axis)
---@field public LPFFrequencyAtMin number @The range of the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the lowpass absorption filter.
---@field public LPFFrequencyAtMax number @The range of the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the lowpass absorption filter.
---@field public HPFFrequencyAtMin number @The range of the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the highpass absorption filter.
---@field public HPFFrequencyAtMax number @The range of the cutoff frequency (in Hz) of the highpass absorption filter.
---@field public FocusAzimuth number @Azimuth angle (in degrees) relative to the listener forward vector which defines the focus region of sounds. Sounds playing at an angle less than this will be in focus.
---@field public NonFocusAzimuth number @Azimuth angle (in degrees) relative to the listener forward vector which defines the non-focus region of sounds. Sounds playing at an angle greater than this will be out of focus.
---@field public FocusDistanceScale number @Amount to scale the distance calculation of sounds that are in-focus. Can be used to make in-focus sounds appear to be closer or further away than they actually are.
---@field public NonFocusDistanceScale number @Amount to scale the distance calculation of sounds that are not in-focus. Can be used to make in-focus sounds appear to be closer or further away than they actually are.
---@field public FocusPriorityScale number @Amount to scale the priority of sounds that are in focus. Can be used to boost the priority of sounds that are in focus.
---@field public NonFocusPriorityScale number @Amount to scale the priority of sounds that are not in-focus. Can be used to reduce the priority of sounds that are not in focus.
---@field public FocusVolumeAttenuation number @Amount to attenuate sounds that are in focus. Can be overridden at the sound-level.
---@field public NonFocusVolumeAttenuation number @Amount to attenuate sounds that are not in focus. Can be overridden at the sound-level.
---@field public FocusAttackInterpSpeed number @Scalar used to increase interpolation speed upwards to the target Focus value
---@field public FocusReleaseInterpSpeed number @Scalar used to increase interpolation speed downwards to the target Focus value
---@field public OcclusionLowPassFilterFrequency number @The low pass filter frequency (in Hz) to apply if the sound playing in this audio component is occluded. This will override the frequency set in LowPassFilterFrequency. A frequency of 0.0 is the device sample rate and will bypass the filter.
---@field public OcclusionVolumeAttenuation number @The amount of volume attenuation to apply to sounds which are occluded.
---@field public OcclusionInterpolationTime number @The amount of time in seconds to interpolate to the target OcclusionLowPassFilterFrequency when a sound is occluded.
---@field public ReverbWetLevelMin number @The amount to send to master reverb when sound is located at a distance equal to value specified in the reverb min send distance.
---@field public ReverbWetLevelMax number @The amount to send to master reverb when sound is located at a distance equal to value specified in the reverb max send distance.
---@field public ReverbDistanceMin number @The min distance to send to the master reverb.
---@field public ReverbDistanceMax number @The max distance to send to the master reverb.
---@field public ManualReverbSendLevel number @The manual master reverb send level to use. Doesn't change as a function of distance.
---@field public CustomReverbSendCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @The custom reverb send curve to use for distance-based send level.
---@field public SubmixSendSettings TArray<FAttenuationSubmixSendSettings> @Set of submix send settings to use to send audio to submixes as a function of distance.
---@field public PriorityAttenuationMin number @Interpolated value to scale priority against when the sound is at the minimum priority attenuation distance from the closest listener.
---@field public PriorityAttenuationMax number @Interpolated value to scale priority against when the sound is at the maximum priority attenuation distance from the closest listener.
---@field public PriorityAttenuationDistanceMin number @The min distance to attenuate priority.
---@field public PriorityAttenuationDistanceMax number @The max distance to attenuate priority.
---@field public ManualPriorityAttenuation number @Static priority scalar to use (doesn't change as a function of distance).
---@field public CustomPriorityAttenuationCurve FRuntimeFloatCurve @The custom curve to use for distance-based priority attenuation.
---@field public PluginSettings FSoundAttenuationPluginSettings @Sound attenuation plugin settings to use with sounds that play with this attenuation setting.
