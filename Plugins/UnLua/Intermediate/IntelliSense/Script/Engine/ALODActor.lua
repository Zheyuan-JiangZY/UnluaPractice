---LODActor is an instance of an autogenerated StaticMesh Actors by Hierarchical LOD System
---This is essentially just StaticMeshActor that you can't move or edit, but it contains multiple actors reference
---@class ALODActor : AActor
---@field private StaticMeshComponent UStaticMeshComponent @disable display of this component
---@field private InstancedStaticMeshComponents TMap<FHLODInstancingKey, UInstancedStaticMeshComponent> @Imposters to be rendered as instanced static meshes
---@field private Proxy UHLODProxy @The mesh proxy used to display this LOD
---@field private Key string @The key used to validate this actor against the proxy
---@field private LODDrawDistance number @what distance do you want this to show up instead of SubActors
---@field public LODLevel integer @The hierarchy level of this actor; the first tier of HLOD is level 1, the second tier is level 2 and so on.
---@field public SubActors TArray<AActor>
---@field public CachedNumHLODLevels integer
---@field public NumTrianglesInSubActors integer @Cached number of triangles contained in the SubActors
---@field public NumTrianglesInMergedMesh integer @Cached number of triangles contained in the SubActors
---@field public bOverrideMaterialMergeSettings boolean @Flag whether or not to use the override MaterialSettings when creating the proxy mesh
---@field public MaterialSettings FMaterialProxySettings @Override Material Settings, used when creating the proxy mesh
---@field public bOverrideTransitionScreenSize boolean @Flag whether or not to use the override TransitionScreenSize for this proxy mesh
---@field public TransitionScreenSize number @Override transition screen size value, determines the screen size at which the proxy is visible The screen size is based around the projected diameter of the bounding sphere of the model. i.e. 0.5 means half the screen's maximum dimension.
---@field public bOverrideScreenSize boolean @Flag whether or not to use the override ScreenSize when creating the proxy mesh
---@field public ScreenSize integer @Override screen size value used in mesh reduction, when creating the proxy mesh
---@field private LODActorTag string
---@field private bBuiltFromHLODDesc boolean
---@field private ProxyDesc UHLODProxyDesc @The hlod proxy desc used to build this LODActor
