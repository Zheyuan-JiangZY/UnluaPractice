---Replicated movement data of our RootComponent.
---Struct used for efficient replication as velocity and location are generally replicated together (this saves a repindex)
---and velocity.Z is commonly zero (most position replications are for walking pawns).
---@class FRepMovement
---@field public LinearVelocity FVector @Velocity of component in world space
---@field public AngularVelocity FVector @Velocity of rotation for component
---@field public Location FVector @Location in world space
---@field public Rotation FRotator @Current rotation
---@field public bSimulatedPhysicSleep boolean @If set, RootComponent should be sleeping.
---@field public bRepPhysics boolean @If set, additional physic data (angular velocity) will be replicated.
---@field public LocationQuantizationLevel EVectorQuantization @Allows tuning the compression level for the replicated location vector. You should only need to change this from the default if you see visual artifacts.
---@field public VelocityQuantizationLevel EVectorQuantization @Allows tuning the compression level for the replicated velocity vectors. You should only need to change this from the default if you see visual artifacts.
---@field public RotationQuantizationLevel ERotatorQuantization @Allows tuning the compression level for replicated rotation. You should only need to change this from the default if you see visual artifacts.
