---A light component that has parallel rays. Will provide a uniform lighting across any affected surface (eg. The Sun). This will affect all objects in the defined light-mass importance volume.
---@class UDirectionalLightComponent : ULightComponent
---@field public ShadowCascadeBiasDistribution number @Controls the depth bias scaling across cascades. This allows to mitigage the shadow acne difference on shadow cascades transition. A value of 1 scales shadow bias based on each cascade size (Default). A value of 0 scales shadow bias uniformly accross all cacascade.
---@field public bEnableLightShaftOcclusion boolean @Whether to occlude fog and atmosphere inscattering with screenspace blurred occlusion from this light.
---@field public OcclusionMaskDarkness number @Controls how dark the occlusion masking is, a value of 1 results in no darkening term.
---@field public OcclusionDepthRange number @Everything closer to the camera than this distance will occlude light shafts.
---@field public LightShaftOverrideDirection FVector @Can be used to make light shafts come from somewhere other than the light's actual direction. This will only be used when non-zero.  It does not have to be normalized.
---@field public DynamicShadowDistanceMovableLight number @How far Cascaded Shadow Map dynamic shadows will cover for a movable light, measured from the camera. A value of 0 disables the dynamic shadow.
---@field public DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight number @How far Cascaded Shadow Map dynamic shadows will cover for a stationary light, measured from the camera. A value of 0 disables the dynamic shadow.
---@field public DynamicShadowCascades integer @Number of cascades to split the view frustum into for the whole scene dynamic shadow. More cascades result in better shadow resolution, but adds significant rendering cost.
---@field public CascadeDistributionExponent number @Controls whether the cascades are distributed closer to the camera (larger exponent) or further from the camera (smaller exponent). An exponent of 1 means that cascade transitions will happen at a distance proportional to their resolution.
---@field public CascadeTransitionFraction number @Proportion of the fade region between cascades. Pixels within the fade region of two cascades have their shadows blended to avoid hard transitions between quality levels. A value of zero eliminates the fade region, creating hard transitions. Higher values increase the size of the fade region, creating a more gradual transition between cascades. The value is expressed as a percentage proportion (i.e. 0.1 = 10% overlap). Ideal values are the smallest possible which still hide the transition. An increased fade region size causes an increase in shadow rendering cost.
---@field public ShadowDistanceFadeoutFraction number @Controls the size of the fade out region at the far extent of the dynamic shadow's influence. This is specified as a fraction of DynamicShadowDistance.
---@field public bUseInsetShadowsForMovableObjects boolean @Stationary lights only: Whether to use per-object inset shadows for movable components, even though cascaded shadow maps are enabled. This allows dynamic objects to have a shadow even when they are outside of the cascaded shadow map, which is important when DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight is small. If DynamicShadowDistanceStationaryLight is large (currently > 8000), this will be forced off. Disabling this can reduce shadowing cost significantly with many movable objects.
---@field public FarShadowCascadeCount integer @0: no DistantShadowCascades, otherwise the count of cascades between WholeSceneDynamicShadowRadius and DistantShadowDistance that are covered by distant shadow cascades.
---@field public FarShadowDistance number @Distance at which the far shadow cascade should end.  Far shadows will cover the range between 'Dynamic Shadow Distance' and this distance.
---@field public DistanceFieldShadowDistance number @Distance at which the ray traced shadow cascade should end.  Distance field shadows will cover the range between 'Dynamic Shadow Distance' this distance.
---@field public LightSourceAngle number @Angle subtended by light source in degrees (also known as angular diameter). Defaults to 0.5357 which is the angle for our sun.
---@field public LightSourceSoftAngle number @Angle subtended by soft light source in degrees.
---@field public ShadowSourceAngleFactor number @Shadow source angle factor, relative to the light source angle. Defaults to 1.0 to coincide with light source angle.
---@field public TraceDistance number @Determines how far shadows can be cast, in world units.  Larger values increase the shadowing cost.
---@field public bUsedAsAtmosphereSunLight boolean @Whether the directional light can interact with the atmosphere, cloud and generate a visual disk. All of which compose the visual sky.
---@field public AtmosphereSunLightIndex integer @Two atmosphere lights are supported. For instance: a sun and a moon, or two suns.
---@field public AtmosphereSunDiskColorScale FLinearColor @A color multiplied with the sun disk luminance.
---@field public bPerPixelAtmosphereTransmittance boolean @Whether to apply atmosphere transmittance per pixel on opaque meshes, instead of using the light global transmittance. Note: VolumetricCloud per pixel transmittance option is selectable on the VolumetricCloud component itself.
---@field public bCastShadowsOnClouds boolean @Whether the light should cast any shadows from opaque meshes onto clouds. This is disabled for AtmosphereLight1.
---@field public bCastShadowsOnAtmosphere boolean @Whether the light should cast any shadows from opaque meshes onto the atmosphere.
---@field public bCastCloudShadows boolean @Whether the light should cast any shadows from clouds onto the atmosphere and other scene elements.
---@field public CloudShadowStrength number @The overall strength of the cloud shadow, higher value will block more light.
---@field public CloudShadowOnAtmosphereStrength number @The strength of the shadow on atmosphere. Disabled when 0.
---@field public CloudShadowOnSurfaceStrength number @The strength of the shadow on opaque and transparent meshes. Disabled when 0.
---@field public CloudShadowDepthBias number @The bias applied to the shadow front depth of the volumetric cloud shadow map.
---@field public CloudShadowExtent number @The world space radius of the cloud shadow map around the camera in kilometers.
---@field public CloudShadowMapResolutionScale number @Scale the cloud shadow map resolution, base resolution is 512. The resolution is still clamped to 'r.VolumetricCloud.ShadowMap.MaxResolution'.
---@field public CloudShadowRaySampleCountScale number @Scale the shadow map tracing sample count. The sample count resolution is still clamped according to scalability setting to 'r.VolumetricCloud.ShadowMap.RaySampleMaxCount'.
---@field public CloudScatteredLuminanceScale FLinearColor @Scales the lights contribution when scattered in cloud participating media. This can help counter balance the fact that our multiple scattering solution is only an approximation.
---@field public LightmassSettings FLightmassDirectionalLightSettings @The Lightmass settings for this object.
---@field public bCastModulatedShadows boolean @Whether the light should cast modulated shadows from dynamic objects (mobile only).  Also requires Cast Shadows to be set to True.
---@field public ModulatedShadowColor FColor @Color to modulate against the scene color when rendering modulated shadows. (mobile only)
---@field public ShadowAmount number @Control the amount of shadow occlusion. A value of 0 means no occlusion, thus no shadow.
