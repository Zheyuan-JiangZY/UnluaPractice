---URuntimeOptionsBase: Base class designed to be subclassed in your game.
---Supports checking at runtime whether features are enabled/disabled, and changing
---configuration parameters via console cheats or startup commands.
---Add new config properties to your subclasses which default to the desired normal state
---This can be adjusted via the development-only tools (command line or cvar) or via an
---override in the config hierarchy to adjust it as needed (e.g., via a hotfix).
---In non-Shipping builds, each property will be exposed both as a console variable and as a
---command-line argument for easy testing during development.
---Debug console syntax (disabled in Shipping configurations):
---  prefix.PropertyName Value
---Command line syntax (disabled in Shipping configurations):
---  -prefix.PropertyName=Value
---DefaultRuntimeOptions.ini syntax (note that there is no prefix for these):
---  [/Script/YourModule.YourRuntimeOptionsSubclass]
---  PropertyName=Value
---Where the prefix is set by the value of OptionCommandPrefix (defaults to "ro" but can be overridden)
---You can also change the name of the ini file that settings are gathered from in your derived
---UCLASS() declaration
---@class URuntimeOptionsBase : UObject
