---Rigid body error correction data
---@class FRigidBodyErrorCorrection
---@field public PingExtrapolation number @Value between 0 and 1 which indicates how much velocity               and ping based correction to use
---@field public PingLimit number @For the purpose of extrapolation, ping will be clamped to this value
---@field public ErrorPerLinearDifference number @Error per centimeter
---@field public ErrorPerAngularDifference number @Error per degree
---@field public MaxRestoredStateError number @Maximum allowable error for a state to be considered "resolved"
---@field public MaxLinearHardSnapDistance number
---@field public PositionLerp number @How much to directly lerp to the correct position. Generally               this should be very low, if not zero. A higher value will               increase precision along with jerkiness.
---@field public AngleLerp number @How much to directly lerp to the correct angle.
---@field public LinearVelocityCoefficient number @This is the coefficient `k` in the differential equation:               dx/dt = k ( x_target(t) - x(t) ), which is used to update               the velocity in a replication step.
---@field public AngularVelocityCoefficient number @This is the angular analog to LinearVelocityCoefficient.
---@field public ErrorAccumulationSeconds number @Number of seconds to remain in a heuristically               unresolveable state before hard snapping.
---@field public ErrorAccumulationDistanceSq number @If the body has moved less than the square root of               this amount towards a resolved state in the previous               frame, then error may accumulate towards a hard snap.
---@field public ErrorAccumulationSimilarity number @If the previous error projected onto the current error               is greater than this value (indicating "similarity"               between states), then error may accumulate towards a               hard snap.
