---PawnNoiseEmitterComponent tracks noise event data used by SensingComponents to hear a Pawn.
---This component is intended to exist on either a Pawn or its Controller. It does nothing on network clients.
---@class UPawnNoiseEmitterComponent : UActorComponent
---@field protected bAIPerceptionSystemCompatibilityMode boolean @If set to true (default value) will notify AIPerceptionSystem about noise events otherwise only PawnSensingComponents will be able to pick up noises generated by this component
---@field public LastRemoteNoisePosition FVector @Most recent noise made by this pawn not at its own location
---@field public NoiseLifetime number @After this amount of time, new sound events will overwrite previous sounds even if they are not louder (allows old sounds to decay)
---@field private LastRemoteNoiseVolume number @Most recent volume of noise made by this pawn not at its own location
---@field private LastRemoteNoiseTime number @Time of last remote noise update
---@field private LastLocalNoiseVolume number @Most recent noise made by this pawn at its own location
---@field private LastLocalNoiseTime number @Time of last local noise update

---Cache noises instigated by the owning pawn for AI sensing
