---Holds the packet simulation settings in one place
---@class FPacketSimulationSettings
---@field public PktLoss integer @When set, will cause calls to FlushNet to drop packets. Value is treated as % of packets dropped (i.e. 0 = None, 100 = All). No general pattern / ordering is guaranteed. Clamped between 0 and 100. Works with all other settings.
---@field public PktLossMaxSize integer @Sets the maximum size of packets in bytes that will be dropped according to the PktLoss setting. Default is INT_MAX. Works with all other settings.
---@field public PktLossMinSize integer @Sets the minimum size of packets in bytes that will be dropped according to the PktLoss setting. Default is 0. Works with all other settings.
---@field public PktOrder integer @When set, will cause calls to FlushNet to change ordering of packets at random. Value is treated as a bool (i.e. 0 = False, anything else = True). This works by randomly selecting packets to be delayed until a subsequent call to FlushNet. Takes precedence over PktDup and PktLag.
---@field public PktDup integer @When set, will cause calls to FlushNet to duplicate packets. Value is treated as % of packets duplicated (i.e. 0 = None, 100 = All). No general pattern / ordering is guaranteed. Clamped between 0 and 100. Cannot be used with PktOrder or PktLag.
---@field public PktLag integer @When set, will cause calls to FlushNet to delay packets. Value is treated as millisecond lag. Cannot be used with PktOrder.
---@field public PktLagVariance integer @When set, will cause PktLag to use variable lag instead of constant. Value is treated as millisecond lag range (e.g. -GivenVariance <= 0 <= GivenVariance). Can only be used when PktLag is enabled.
---@field public PktLagMin integer @If set lag values will randomly fluctuate between Min and Max. Ignored if PktLag value is set
---@field public PktLagMax integer
---@field public PktIncomingLagMin integer @Set a value to add a minimum delay in milliseconds to incoming packets before they are processed.
---@field public PktIncomingLagMax integer @The maximum delay in milliseconds to add to incoming packets before they are processed.
---@field public PktIncomingLoss integer @The ratio of incoming packets that will be dropped to simulate packet loss
---@field public PktJitter integer @Causes sent packets to have a variable latency that fluctuates from [PktLagMin] to [PktLagMin+PktJitter] Note that this will cause packet loss on the receiving end.
