---Bookmarks are objects that can keep track of specific locations within a level or scene, without
---necessarily adding additional actors to that scene.
---Different implementations can be used depending on specific needs, and new implementations can
---be generated by implementing a class Derived on UBookmarkBase.
---See UBookMark, UBookMark2D, AGameWorldSettings::DefaultBookmarkClass, IBookmarkEditorInteractor.
---@class UBookmarkBase : UObject
local UBookmarkBase = {}
