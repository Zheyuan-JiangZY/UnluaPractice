---@field public Intensity number @Multiplier for all bloom contributions >=0: off, 1(default), >1 brighter
---@field public Threshold number @minimum brightness the bloom starts having effect -1:all pixels affect bloom equally (physically correct, faster as a threshold pass is omitted), 0:all pixels affect bloom brights more, 1(default), >1 brighter
---@field public SizeScale number @Scale for all bloom sizes
---@field public Filter1Size number @Diameter size for the Bloom1 in percent of the screen width (is done in 1/2 resolution, larger values cost more performance, good for high frequency details) >=0: can be clamped because of shader limitations
---@field public Filter2Size number @Diameter size for Bloom2 in percent of the screen width (is done in 1/4 resolution, larger values cost more performance) >=0: can be clamped because of shader limitations
---@field public Filter3Size number @Diameter size for Bloom3 in percent of the screen width (is done in 1/8 resolution, larger values cost more performance) >=0: can be clamped because of shader limitations
---@field public Filter4Size number @Diameter size for Bloom4 in percent of the screen width (is done in 1/16 resolution, larger values cost more performance, best for wide contributions) >=0: can be clamped because of shader limitations
---@field public Filter5Size number @Diameter size for Bloom5 in percent of the screen width (is done in 1/32 resolution, larger values cost more performance, best for wide contributions) >=0: can be clamped because of shader limitations
---@field public Filter6Size number @Diameter size for Bloom6 in percent of the screen width (is done in 1/64 resolution, larger values cost more performance, best for wide contributions) >=0: can be clamped because of shader limitations
