---Pose data
---This is one pose data structure
---This will let us blend poses quickly easily
---All poses within this asset should contain same number of tracks,
---so that we can blend quickly
---@class FPoseData
---@field public SourceLocalSpacePose TArray<FTransform> @source local space pose, this pose is always full pose the size this array matches Tracks in the pose container
---@field public SourceCurveData TArray<number> @source curve data that is full value
---@field public LocalSpacePose TArray<FTransform> @local space pose, # of array match with # of TrackToBufferIndex it only saves the one with delta as base pose or ref pose if full pose
---@field public TrackToBufferIndex TMap<integer, integer> @this is PoseContainer.Tracks to Buffer Index of LocalSpacePose
---@field public CurveData TArray<number> @# of array match with # of Curves in PoseDataContainer curve data is not compressed
