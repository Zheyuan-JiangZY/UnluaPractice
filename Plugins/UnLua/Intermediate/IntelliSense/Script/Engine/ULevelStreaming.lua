---Abstract base class of container object encapsulating data required for streaming and providing
---interface for when a level should be streamed in and out of memory.
---@class ULevelStreaming : UObject
---@field private WorldAsset TSoftObjectPtr<UWorld> @The reference to the world containing the level to load
---@field public PackageNameToLoad string @If this isn't Name_None, then we load from this package on disk to the new package named PackageName
---@field public LODPackageNames TArray<string> @LOD versions of this level
---@field public LevelTransform FTransform @Transform applied to actors after loading.
---@field private LevelLODIndex integer @Requested LOD. Non LOD sub-levels have Index = -1
---@field private StreamingPriority integer @The relative priority of considering the streaming level. Changing the priority will not interrupt the currently considered level, but will affect the next time a level is being selected for evaluation.
---@field private bShouldBeVisibleInEditor boolean @Whether this level should be visible in the Editor
---@field private bShouldBeVisible boolean @Whether the level should be visible if it is loaded
---@field protected bShouldBeLoaded boolean @Whether the level should be loaded
---@field public bLocked boolean @Whether this level is locked; that is, its actors are read-only.
---@field public bIsStatic boolean @Whether this level only contains static actors that aren't affected by gameplay or replication. If true, the engine can make certain optimizations and will add this level to the StaticLevels collection.
---@field public bShouldBlockOnLoad boolean @Whether we want to force a blocking load
---@field public bShouldBlockOnUnload boolean @Whether we want to force a blocking unload
---@field public bDisableDistanceStreaming boolean @Whether this level streaming object should be ignored by world composition distance streaming, so streaming state can be controlled by other systems (ex: in blueprints)
---@field public bDrawOnLevelStatusMap boolean @If true, will be drawn on the 'level streaming status' map (STAT LEVELMAP console command)
---@field public LevelColor FLinearColor @The level color used for visualization. (Show -> Advanced -> Level Coloration)
---@field public EditorStreamingVolumes TArray<ALevelStreamingVolume> @The level streaming volumes bound to this level.
---@field public MinTimeBetweenVolumeUnloadRequests number @Cooldown time in seconds between volume-based unload requests.  Used in preventing spurious unload requests.
---@field public Keywords TArray<string> @List of keywords to filter on in the level browser
---@field public OnLevelLoaded MulticastDelegate @Called when level is streamed in
---@field public OnLevelUnloaded MulticastDelegate @Called when level is streamed out
---@field public OnLevelShown MulticastDelegate @Called when level is added to the world
---@field public OnLevelHidden MulticastDelegate @Called when level is removed from the world
---@field private LoadedLevel ULevel @Pointer to Level object if currently loaded/ streamed in.
---@field private PendingUnloadLevel ULevel @Pointer to a Level object that was previously active and was replaced with a new LoadedLevel (for LOD switching)
---@field private FolderPath string @The folder path for this level within the world browser. This is only available in editor builds.               A NONE path indicates that it exists at the root. It is '/' separated.

---Return whether this level should be present in memory which in turn tells the
---streaming code to stream it in. Please note that a change in value from false
---to true only tells the streaming code that it needs to START streaming it in
---so the code needs to return true an appropriate amount of time before it is
---needed.
