---@class UParticleEmitter : UObject
---@field public EmitterName string @The name of the emitter.
---@field public SubUVDataOffset integer
---@field public EmitterRenderMode integer @How to render the emitter particles. Can be one of the following:         ERM_Normal      - As the intended sprite/mesh         ERM_Point       - As a 2x2 pixel block with no scaling and the color set in EmitterEditorColor         ERM_Cross       - As a cross of lines, scaled to the size of the particle in EmitterEditorColor         ERM_None        - Do not render
---@field public SignificanceLevel EParticleSignificanceLevel @The significance level required of this emitter's owner for this emitter to be active.
---@field public bUseLegacySpawningBehavior boolean @If true, maintains some legacy spawning behavior.
---@field public ConvertedModules boolean
---@field public bIsSoloing boolean @If true, then show only this emitter in the editor
---@field public bCookedOut boolean @If true, then this emitter was 'cooked out' by the cooker. This means it was completely disabled, but to preserve any indexing schemes, it is left in place.
---@field public bDisabledLODsKeepEmitterAlive boolean @When true, if the current LOD is disabled the emitter will be kept alive. Otherwise, the emitter will be considered complete if the current LOD is disabled.
---@field public bDisableWhenInsignficant boolean @When true, emitters deemed insignificant will have their tick and render disabled Instantly. When false they will simple stop spawning new particles.
---@field public bCollapsed boolean @This value indicates the emitter should be drawn 'collapsed' in Cascade
---@field public EmitterEditorColor FColor @The color of the emitter in the curve editor and debug rendering modes.
---@field public LODLevels TArray<UParticleLODLevel> @'Private' data - not required by the editor
---@field public PeakActiveParticles integer
---@field public InitialAllocationCount integer @Initial allocation count - overrides calculated peak count if > 0
---@field public QualityLevelSpawnRateScale number
---@field public DetailModeBitmask integer @Detail mode: Set flags reflecting which system detail mode you want the emitter to be ticked and rendered in
---@field public DetailModeDisplay string
