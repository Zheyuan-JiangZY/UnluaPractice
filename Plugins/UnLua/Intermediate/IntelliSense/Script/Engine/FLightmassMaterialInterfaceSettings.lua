---UMaterial interface settings for Lightmass
---@class FLightmassMaterialInterfaceSettings
---@field public EmissiveBoost number @Scales the emissive contribution of this material to static lighting.
---@field public DiffuseBoost number @Scales the diffuse contribution of this material to static lighting.
---@field public ExportResolutionScale number @Scales the resolution that this material's attributes were exported at. This is useful for increasing material resolution when details are needed.
---@field public bCastShadowAsMasked boolean @If true, forces translucency to cast static shadows as if the material were masked.
---@field public bOverrideCastShadowAsMasked boolean @If true, override the bCastShadowAsMasked setting of the parent material.
---@field public bOverrideEmissiveBoost boolean @If true, override the emissive boost setting of the parent material.
---@field public bOverrideDiffuseBoost boolean @If true, override the diffuse boost setting of the parent material.
---@field public bOverrideExportResolutionScale boolean @If true, override the export resolution scale setting of the parent material.
