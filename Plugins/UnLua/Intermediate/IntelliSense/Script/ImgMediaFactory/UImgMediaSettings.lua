---Settings for the ImgMedia module.
---@class UImgMediaSettings : UObject
---@field public DefaultFrameRate FFrameRate @Default frame rate to use if none was specified in image sequence or media source (default = 1/24).
---@field public CacheBehindPercentage number @Percentage of cache to use for frames behind the play head (default = 25%).
---@field public CacheSizeGB number @Maximum size of the look-ahead cache (in GB; default = 1 GB).
---@field public CacheThreads integer @Maximum number of image caching threads to use (0 = number of cores, default = 8).
---@field public CacheThreadStackSizeKB integer @Size of the stack for each caching thread (in kB; default = 128).
---@field public GlobalCacheSizeGB number @Maximum size of the global look-ahead cache (in GB; default = 1 GB). Must be greater or equal to CacheSizeGB.
---@field public UseGlobalCache boolean @Whether to use the global cache or not.
---@field public ExrDecoderThreads integer @Number of worker threads to use when decoding EXR images (0 = auto).
---@field private DefaultProxy string @Name of default media source proxy URLs (default = 'proxy'). Image sequence media sources may contain more than one media source URL. Additional URLs are called media source proxies, and they are generally used for switching to lower resolution media content for improved performance during development and testing. Each proxy URL has a name associated with it, such as 'proxy', 'lowres', or any other user defined tag. It is up to the media source to interpret this value and map it to a media source URL. For example, a media source consisting of a sequence of uncompressed images may use a proxy name as the name of the sub-directory that contains proxy content, such as a low-res version of the image sequence. When default proxies are enabled via the UseDefaultProxy setting, media players will first try to locate the proxy content identified by the DefaultProxy tag. If no such proxy content is available, they will fall back to the media source's default URL.
---@field private UseDefaultProxy boolean @Whether to enable image sequence proxies (default = false). Image sequence media sources may contain more than one media source URL.
