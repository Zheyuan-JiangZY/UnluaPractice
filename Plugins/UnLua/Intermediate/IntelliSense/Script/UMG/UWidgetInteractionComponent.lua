---This is a component to allow interaction with the Widget Component.  This class allows you to
---simulate a sort of laser pointer device, when it hovers over widgets it will send the basic signals
---to show as if the mouse were moving on top of it.  You'll then tell the component to simulate key presses,
---like Left Mouse, down and up, to simulate a mouse click.
---@class UWidgetInteractionComponent : USceneComponent
---@field public OnHoveredWidgetChanged MulticastDelegate @Called when the hovered Widget Component changes.  The interaction component functions at the Slate level - so it's unable to report anything about what UWidget is under the hit result.
---@field public VirtualUserIndex integer @Represents the Virtual User Index.  Each virtual user should be represented by a different index number, this will maintain separate capture and focus states for them.  Each controller or finger-tip should get a unique PointerIndex.
---@field public PointerIndex integer @Each user virtual controller or virtual finger tips being simulated should use a different pointer index.
---@field public TraceChannel integer @The trace channel to use when tracing for widget components in the world.
---@field public InteractionDistance number @The distance in game units the component should be able to interact with a widget component.
---@field public InteractionSource EWidgetInteractionSource @Should we project from the world location of the component?  If you set this to false, you'll need to call SetCustomHitResult(), and provide the result of a custom hit test form whatever location you wish.
---@field public bEnableHitTesting boolean @Should the interaction component perform hit testing (Automatic or Custom) and attempt to simulate hover - if you were going to emulate a keyboard you would want to turn this option off if the virtual keyboard was separate from the virtual pointer device and used a second interaction component.
---@field public bShowDebug boolean @Shows some debugging lines and a hit sphere to help you debug interactions.
---@field public DebugSphereLineThickness number @Determines the line thickness of the debug sphere.
---@field public DebugLineThickness number @Determines the thickness of the debug lines.
---@field public DebugColor FLinearColor @Determines the color of the debug lines.
---@field protected CustomHitResult FHitResult @Stores the custom hit result set by the player.
---@field protected LocalHitLocation FVector2D @The 2D location on the widget component that was hit.
---@field protected LastLocalHitLocation FVector2D @The last 2D location on the widget component that was hit.
---@field protected HoveredWidgetComponent UWidgetComponent @The widget component we're currently hovering over.
---@field protected LastHitResult FHitResult @The last hit result we used.
---@field protected bIsHoveredWidgetInteractable boolean @Are we hovering over any interactive widgets.
---@field protected bIsHoveredWidgetFocusable boolean @Are we hovering over any focusable widget?
---@field protected bIsHoveredWidgetHitTestVisible boolean @Are we hovered over a widget that is hit test visible?
---@field private ArrowComponent UArrowComponent @The arrow component we show at editor time.
local UWidgetInteractionComponent = {}

---Set the focus target of the virtual user managed by this component
---@param FocusWidget UWidget
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:SetFocus(FocusWidget) end

---Set custom hit result.  This is only taken into account if InteractionSource is set to EWidgetInteractionSource::Custom.
---@param HitResult FHitResult
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:SetCustomHitResult(HitResult) end

---Transmits a list of characters to a widget by simulating a OnKeyChar event for each key listed in
---the string.
---@param Characters string
---@param bRepeat boolean @[opt] 
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:SendKeyChar(Characters, bRepeat) end

---Sends a scroll wheel event to the widget under the last hit result.
---@param ScrollDelta number
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:ScrollWheel(ScrollDelta) end

---Releases a key as if the mouse/pointer were the source of it.  Normally you would just use
---Left/Right mouse button for the Key.  However - advanced uses could also be imagined where you
---send other keys to signal widgets to take special actions if they're under the cursor.
---@param Key FKey
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:ReleasePointerKey(Key) end

---Releases a key as if it had been released by the keyboard.
---@param Key FKey
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:ReleaseKey(Key) end

---Presses a key as if the mouse/pointer were the source of it.  Normally you would just use
---Left/Right mouse button for the Key.  However - advanced uses could also be imagined where you
---send other keys to signal widgets to take special actions if they're under the cursor.
---@param Key FKey
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:PressPointerKey(Key) end

---Press a key as if it had come from the keyboard.  Avoid using this for 'a-z|A-Z', things like
---the Editable Textbox in Slate expect OnKeyChar to be called to signal a specific character being
---send to the widget.  So for those cases you should use SendKeyChar.
---@param Key FKey
---@param bRepeat boolean @[opt] 
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:PressKey(Key, bRepeat) end

---Does both the press and release of a simulated keyboard key.
---@param Key FKey
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:PressAndReleaseKey(Key) end

---Returns true if a widget under the hit result is interactive.  e.g. Slate widgets
---that return true for IsInteractable().
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:IsOverInteractableWidget() end

---Returns true if a widget under the hit result is has a visibility that makes it hit test
---visible.  e.g. Slate widgets that return true for GetVisibility().IsHitTestVisible().
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:IsOverHitTestVisibleWidget() end

---Returns true if a widget under the hit result is focusable.  e.g. Slate widgets that
---return true for SupportsKeyboardFocus().
---@return boolean
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:IsOverFocusableWidget() end

---Gets the last hit result generated by the component.  Returns the custom hit result if that was set.
---@return FHitResult
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:GetLastHitResult() end

---Get the currently hovered widget component.
---@return UWidgetComponent
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:GetHoveredWidgetComponent() end

---Gets the last hit location on the widget in 2D, local pixel units of the render target.
---@return FVector2D
function UWidgetInteractionComponent:Get2DHitLocation() end
