---@class FChaosClothWeightedValue
---@field public Low number @Parameter value corresponding to the lower bound of the Weight Map. A Weight Map stores a series of Weight values assigned to each point, all between 0 and 1. The weights are used to interpolate the individual values from Low to High assigned to each different point. A Weight of 0 always corresponds to the Low parameter value, and a Weight of 1 to the High parameter value. The value for Low can be set to be bigger than for High in order to reverse the effect of the Weight Map.
---@field public High number @Parameter value corresponding to the upper bound of the Weight Map. A Weight Map stores a series of Weight values assigned to each point, all between 0 and 1. The weights are used to interpolate the individual values from Low to High assigned to each different point. A Weight of 0 always corresponds to the Low parameter value, and a Weight of 1 to the High parameter value. The value for Low can be set to be bigger than for High in order to reverse the effect of the Weight Map.
