---@field public MaterialUserParamBinding FNiagaraUserParameterBinding @Use the UMaterialInterface bound to this user variable if it is set to a valid value. If this is bound to a valid value and Material is also set, UserParamBinding wins.
---@field public FacingMode ENiagaraRibbonFacingMode
---@field public UV0Settings FNiagaraRibbonUVSettings
---@field public UV1Settings FNiagaraRibbonUVSettings
---@field public DrawDirection ENiagaraRibbonDrawDirection @If true, the particles are only sorted when using a translucent material.
---@field public Shape ENiagaraRibbonShapeMode @Shape of the ribbon, from flat plane, multiplane, 3d tube, and custom shapes.
---@field public bEnableAccurateGeometry boolean @Double geometry count, to allow for correct geometry on both sides of MultiPlane. With this off, MultiPlane will switch normals based on view direction, but this could potentially cause issues in some materials
---@field public WidthSegmentationCount integer @Tessellation factor to apply to the width of the ribbon. Ranges from 1 to 16. Greater values increase amount of tessellation.
---@field public MultiPlaneCount integer @Number of planes in multiplane shape. Evenly distributed from 0-90 or 0-180 degrees off camera facing depending on setting
---@field public TubeSubdivisions integer @Number of vertices/faces in a tube.
---@field public CustomVertices TArray<FNiagaraRibbonShapeCustomVertex> @Vertices for a cross section of the ribbon in custom shape mode.
---@field public CurveTension number @Defines the curve tension, or how long the curve's tangents are. Ranges from 0 to 1. The higher the value, the sharper the curve becomes.
---@field public TessellationMode ENiagaraRibbonTessellationMode @Defines the tessellation mode allowing custom tessellation parameters or disabling tessellation entirely.
---@field public TessellationFactor integer @Custom tessellation factor. Ranges from 1 to 16. Greater values increase amount of tessellation.
---@field public bUseConstantFactor boolean @If checked, use the above constant factor. Otherwise, adaptively select the tessellation factor based on the below parameters.
---@field public TessellationAngle number @Defines the angle in degrees at which tessellation occurs. Ranges from 1 to 180. Smaller values increase amount of tessellation. If set to 0, use the maximum tessellation set above.
---@field public bScreenSpaceTessellation boolean @If checked, use the ribbon's screen space percentage to adaptively adjust the tessellation factor.
