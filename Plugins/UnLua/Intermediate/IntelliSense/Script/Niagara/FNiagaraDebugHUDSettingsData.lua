---Settings for Niagara debug HUD. Contained in it's own struct so that we can pass it whole in a message to the debugger client.
---@class FNiagaraDebugHUDSettingsData
---@field public bEnabled boolean @Master control for all HUD features.
---@field public bValidateSystemSimulationDataBuffers boolean @When enabled all Niagara systems that pass the filter will have the simulation data buffers validation. i.e. we will look for NaN or other invalidate data  inside it Note: This will have an impact on performance.
---@field public bValidateParticleDataBuffers boolean @When enabled all Niagara systems that pass the filter will have the particle data buffers validation. i.e. we will look for NaN or other invalidate data  inside it Note: This will have an impact on performance.
---@field public bOverviewEnabled boolean @When enabled the overview display will be enabled.
---@field public OverviewFont ENiagaraDebugHudFont @Overview display font to use.
---@field public OverviewLocation FVector2D @Overview display location.
---@field public ActorFilter string @Wildcard filter which is compared against the Components Actor name to narrow down the detailed information. For example, "*Water*" would match all actors that contain the string "water".
---@field public bComponentFilterEnabled boolean
---@field public ComponentFilter string @Wildcard filter for the components to show more detailed information about. For example, "*MyComp*" would match all components that contain MyComp.
---@field public bSystemFilterEnabled boolean
---@field public SystemFilter string @Wildcard filter for the systems to show more detailed information about. For example,. "NS_*" would match all systems starting with NS_.
---@field public bEmitterFilterEnabled boolean
---@field public EmitterFilter string @Wildcard filter used to match emitters when generating particle attribute view. For example,. "Fluid*" would match all emtiters starting with Fluid and only particle attributes for those would be visible.
---@field public bActorFilterEnabled boolean
---@field public SystemDebugVerbosity ENiagaraDebugHudVerbosity @When enabled system debug information will be displayed in world.
---@field public SystemEmitterVerbosity ENiagaraDebugHudVerbosity @When enabled we show information about emitter / particle counts.
---@field public bSystemShowBounds boolean @When enabled will show the system bounds for all filtered systems.
---@field public bSystemShowActiveOnlyInWorld boolean @When disabled in world rendering will show systems deactivated by scalability.
---@field public bShowSystemVariables boolean @Should we display the system attributes.
---@field public SystemVariables TArray<FNiagaraDebugHUDVariable> @List of attributes to show about the system, each entry uses wildcard matching. For example, "System.*" would match all system attributes.
---@field public SystemTextOptions FNiagaraDebugHudTextOptions @Sets display text options for system information.
---@field public bShowParticleVariables boolean @When enabled will show particle attributes from the list.
---@field public bEnableGpuParticleReadback boolean @When enabled GPU particle data will be copied from the GPU to the CPU. Warning: This has an impact on performance & memory since we copy the whole buffer. The displayed data is latent since we are seeing what happened a few frames ago.
---@field public ParticlesVariables TArray<FNiagaraDebugHUDVariable> @List of attributes to show per particle, each entry uses wildcard matching. For example, "*Position" would match all attributes that end in Position.
---@field public ParticleTextOptions FNiagaraDebugHudTextOptions @Sets display text options for particle information.
---@field public bShowParticlesVariablesWithSystem boolean @When enabled particle attributes will display with the system information rather than in world at the particle location.
---@field public bUseMaxParticlesToDisplay boolean
---@field public MaxParticlesToDisplay integer @When enabled, the maximum number of particles to show information about. When disabled all particles will show attributes, this can result in poor performance & potential OOM on some platforms.
---@field public PlaybackMode ENiagaraDebugPlaybackMode
---@field public bPlaybackRateEnabled boolean
---@field public PlaybackRate number
---@field public bLoopTimeEnabled boolean
---@field public LoopTime number
---@field public bShowGlobalBudgetInfo boolean
